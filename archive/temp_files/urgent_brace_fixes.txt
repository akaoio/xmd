=== URGENT: BUILD AT 21% - 4 FILES NEED BRACE FIXES ===
Systems Engineer Real-Time Support

DEVELOPER IS DOING EXCELLENT WORK! Just 4 more files to fix:

1. ast_free.c - Build reports 9 brace errors but file looks OK
   - Might be a parsing issue or hidden character problem
   - Try re-saving the file or checking for non-visible characters

2. ast_add_argument.c - 2 brace errors
   - Check around line 34 (} else { block)
   - Missing closing brace somewhere

3. ast_add_element.c - Brace errors
   - Similar pattern to add_argument

4. ast_add_method.c - 3 brace errors  
   - Check line 28 and 46 mentioned in errors

PATTERN: These util files have complex nested logic that's easy to miss braces in.

QUICK TEST: Developer can run ./build.sh to verify each fix

SYSTEMS ENGINEER: Standing by for immediate support!
Build progress: 10% → 12% → 17% → 19% → 21% - Excellent momentum!
