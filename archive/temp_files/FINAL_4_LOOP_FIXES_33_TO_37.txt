=== SYSTEMS ENGINEER: FINAL 4 FILES FOR 33% → 37% BUILD ===

EXCELLENT PROGRESS! Expression parsers ALL FIXED!

REMAINING LOOP/PROGRAM PARSERS:

1. ast_parse_loop.c (7 missing braces)
   - Missing closing braces for nested if/while blocks
   - Pattern: 6 missing } before final }

2. ast_parse_range_loop.c (13 missing braces) 
   - Complex nested if/for blocks incomplete
   - Pattern: Multiple missing } throughout

3. ast_parse_while.c (9 missing braces)
   - While loop body parsing incomplete
   - Pattern: 8 missing } before final }

4. ast_parse_program.c (3 missing braces)
   - Simple: only 2 missing } before final }

SYSTEMS ENGINEER: Same brace pattern as previous files!
Developer can use similar fixes → 37%+ build!
