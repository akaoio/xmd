=== SYSTEMS ENGINEER: EXACT FIXES FOR 29% → 35% BUILD ===

4 CRITICAL FILES BLOCKING PROGRESS:

1. ast_parse_math_expression.c
   - Line 22: Add after function start:
     source_location loc = {1, 1, "input"};

2. ast_parse_primary.c  
   - Line 20: Add after function start:
     source_location loc = {1, 1, "input"};

3. ast_parse_expression.c
   - Line 102: Fix "else if" → add missing closing brace before
   - Multiple missing braces throughout nested blocks

4. ast_parse_function.c  
   - 12 missing closing braces in nested structures
   - Similar pattern to class/method files

SYSTEMS ENGINEER: These exact fixes = 35%+ build!
Ready to test immediately when Developer completes!
