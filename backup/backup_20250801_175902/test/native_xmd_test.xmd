# Genesis's Mobile-First XMD Language Test

This file demonstrates Genesis's vision for mobile-optimized programming:

set name "Genesis"
set age 25
set greeting "Hello, I am the creator"

print greeting
print "My name is " + name
print "I am {{age}} years old"

function welcome user
    print "Welcome " + user + " to XMD!"
    print "Genesis's mobile-first programming language"

welcome "Alice"
welcome "Bob"

set active true
if age >= 18
    print "Genesis is an adult"
else
    print "Genesis is young"

# Template string interpolation test
set message "Hi {{name}}, you are {{age}} years old, created by Genesis"
print message

# This demonstrates Genesis's vision:
# - No parentheses required: welcome "Alice" 
# - Natural language keywords: set, print, if, function
# - Touch-friendly syntax: spaces instead of symbols
# - Template interpolation: {{variable}} patterns
# - Mobile-optimized: easy to type on phone keyboards
