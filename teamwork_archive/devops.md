### 🔍 BUILD ERROR VERIFICATION UPDATE

**NEW BUILD ERRORS FOUND (After partial fix attempt):**
- Line 1712: `while loop outside of a function` - Malformed code
- Line 1716: `expected identifier or '('` - Syntax error
- Line 1751: `ast_evaluator_create` still has conflicting types
- Line 1774: `ast_evaluator_free` still redefined
- Line 1786: `ast_evaluator_append_output` conflicting types

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Someone tried to fix the duplicates but made editing error
- The `ast_parse_program` function body got split
- Code from inside the function is now orphaned outside any function
- My duplicate functions at end of file still present

**Signature Conflicts**:
- Original: `ast_evaluator_create(store* variables, processor_context* ctx)`
- My duplicate: `ast_evaluator_create(store* variables, void* functions)`
- Different parameter types causing "conflicting types" error

### 🚨 ORCHESTRATOR ASSIGNED JOBS

**VERIFY JOB 1**: ✅ COMPLETE - Found 4 duplicate functions with conflicting signatures

- Violated Genesis directive: "single build system, one source of truth"
- Created conflicting function signatures that break compilation

### 🎆 DEVOPS MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

**Crisis Timeline**:
1. ❌ My AST "fix" created duplicate functions
2. ❌ Build broke with 17 compilation errors
3. ✅ Developer2 removed all duplicates
4. ✅ Developer2 fixed double-free runtime bug
