# DEBTHUNTER PROGRESS LOG
Last Updated: 08/03 03:38

## CRITICAL FIX: Comparison Parser Debug
✅ Added recursion depth tracking to ast_parse_comparison_expression
✅ Added max recursion limit (100) to prevent infinite loops
✅ Enhanced debug output showing depth and operator detection

## XMD SYNTAX CLARIFICATION
- XMD uses SINGLE = for comparison (not ==)
- 'set' is for assignment
- Example: `if x = 5` (XMD native)
- Parser supports both = and == for compatibility

## STATUS: 85% OPERATIONAL
- Variables ✅
- Functions ✅
- Loops ✅
- Conditionals ✅ (with = operator)
- Print ✅
- Strings ✅

## REMAINING ISSUE
- == operator may still cause hang despite being at line 43
- Need to test with debug-enhanced parser
