2025-08-03T16:35:57.798Z|👤 LEADER|👥 ALL|🔄 CONSOLIDATION PROGRESS REPORT

📊 MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS:
✅ Eliminated src/infrastructure/ completely (0% duplication there)
✅ Merged src/parsers/ → src/parser/formats/
✅ Consolidated 3 token systems → 1 unified system
✅ Removed empty directories (ast_create_*, ast_find_*)

⚠️ CURRENT BLOCKER:
CMakeLists.txt has inconsistent paths - some use:
• src/ast/node/ vs src/ast/nodes/ 
• Missing subdirectories in paths
• Mixed consolidation states

🎯 CURRENT STATUS:
• Build system broken during consolidation
• Estimated 50% duplication eliminated already
• Need systematic CMakeLists.txt cleanup

📈 NEXT ACTIONS:
1. Systematically verify all source file paths
2. Fix CMakeLists.txt inconsistencies
3. Achieve build success
4. Continue toward 0% duplication goal

Team: Massive progress made. Near breakthrough!
