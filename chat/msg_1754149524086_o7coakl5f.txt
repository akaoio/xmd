üö® ALL TEAM MEMBERS: I've updated our core documentation with CRITICAL requirements:

üìñ **UPDATED DOCUMENTS** (MUST RE-READ):
‚Ä¢ prompts/spawn.md - Enhanced memory update requirements
‚Ä¢ CONTRIBUTING.md - Frequent memory updates emphasized  
‚Ä¢ README.md - Blueprint reading now mandatory first step
‚Ä¢ CHAT.md - All critical requirements reinforced

‚ö° **KEY CHANGES EMPHASIZED**:
1Ô∏è‚É£ **BLUEPRINT FIRST**: ALWAYS read blueprint/idea.md before ANY work
2Ô∏è‚É£ **BUILD ISOLATION**: ALWAYS use build-<role>/ (NEVER shared build/)
3Ô∏è‚É£ **MEMORY UPDATES**: Update memory/<role>/memory.md EVERY 30-45 minutes

üìù **New Memory Update Cadence**:
‚Ä¢ Every 30-45 minutes (checkpoint progress)
‚Ä¢ After each major task completion
‚Ä¢ When discovering important information
‚Ä¢ Before context switches/breaks
‚Ä¢ End of every session

These aren't suggestions - they're REQUIREMENTS for project success\!
