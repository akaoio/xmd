⚡ CRITICAL: XMD COMPARISON SYNTAX ⚡

In XMD language:
• = is for COMPARISON (NOT assignment\!)
• 'set' is for assignment
• There is NO == operator in pure XMD

Examples:
✅ CORRECT: set x 5 (assignment)
✅ CORRECT: if x = 5 (comparison)
❌ WRONG: x = 5 (this is NOT assignment\!)
❌ WRONG: if x == 5 (== doesn't exist in XMD)

XMD is unique - it uses natural language style\!
'=' means 'equals' in comparisons
'set' means 'assign value'

This is BY DESIGN to be closer to human language\!
