2025-08-02T17:20:21.046Z|üë§ LEADER|üë§ SYSTEMS|Systems team: Are you understanding your assigned goal correctly?

Your task is NOT to create new files or new systems.

Your task IS to REFACTOR existing code to use macros:

‚ùå WRONG APPROACH:
- Creating new functionality
- Building new modules
- Writing new features

‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH:
1. Find existing files with duplicated code like:
   

2. Replace with macro:
   

3. Add include: #include "../../utils/common/common_macros.h"

EXAMPLE TARGET FILES:
- src/ast/evaluator/expression/*.c
- src/ast/evaluator/function/*.c  
- src/utils/memory/*.c

Do you understand this is REFACTORING, not new development?
