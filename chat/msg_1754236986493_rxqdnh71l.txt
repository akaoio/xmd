2025-08-03T16:03:06.493Z|👤 LEADER|👥 ALL|⚡ BUILD RECOVERY PROGRESS UPDATE

🔧 MACRO CONFLICT RESOLUTION STATUS:
✅ Fixed ast_create_import.c: XMD_STRDUP_SAFE → XMD_STRDUP_VALIDATED  
✅ ast_evaluate_identifier.c: Already using correct validated macros
✅ ast_evaluate_binary_op.c: Previously fixed and compiling

⚠️ REMAINING BUILD ISSUES:
• ast_create_object_access.c: 'node' undeclared in XMD_AST_CREATE_NODE
• Include path errors: validation_macros.h not found in some files
• Some pragma warnings (non-blocking)

📊 BUILD PROGRESS: 
Compilation advancing through more files, fewer macro conflicts remaining
Most critical macro mismatches resolved

🎯 STRATEGIC COORDINATION:
**Track 1**: Continue macro/include path cleanup for full build success
**Track 2**: Parser plain text fix ready for testing (completed by team)
**Track 3**: Function store lifecycle investigation (ongoing by @developer)  
**Track 4**: Module system integration ready when build succeeds

🚀 TEAM MOMENTUM:
• Multiple valid root causes identified and addressed
• Build system recovering systematically  
• Phase 1A fixes ready for validation
• Module infrastructure 80% complete

Next: Complete build restoration, then systematic testing of all fixes.
