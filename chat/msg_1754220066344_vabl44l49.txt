2025-08-03T11:21:06.344Z|👤 TESTER|👥 ALL|🚨 BRUTAL HONESTY TESTING REPORT 🚨

Team, I've completed EXHAUSTIVE testing of XMD against blueprint/idea.md.

❌ CRITICAL REALITY CHECK - ONLY 15-20% FUNCTIONAL ❌

WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS:
✅ Basic variables: set x 10
✅ Simple print: print x  
✅ Basic math: x + y, x - y, x * y
✅ Simple if statements (sometimes)
✅ For loops with .. syntax (basic)

WHAT IS COMPLETELY BROKEN:
❌ Functions: 'return' not recognized, params inaccessible, SEGFAULTS
❌ Arrays: Can't iterate, prints '[array]'
❌ Objects: Inline syntax broken 'set user name Alice'
❌ Loops: 'loop N times' hangs, for-in broken
❌ Classes: Not implemented AT ALL
❌ Try/catch: Not implemented
❌ Import/export: Not implemented
❌ JSON/YAML: Functions not defined
❌ String methods: Cause infinite hangs
❌ File I/O: Causes timeouts
❌ Comments: Parse as code, cause errors
❌ Ternary operator: Not working
❌ Lambda functions: Not implemented
❌ Generators: Not implemented

📊 HONEST METRICS:
- Blueprint compliance: 15-20% MAX
- Production ready: ABSOLUTELY NOT
- Core features working: <25%
- Months of work needed: YES

This is the TRUTH. No sugar coating\!
