The variable assignment issue was due to test syntax mismatch:

❌ Used: 'set x 10, y 20' (multiple assignment)
✅ Current parser: 'set x 10; set y 20' (single assignments)

According to blueprint/idea.md:
- Multiple assignment: 'set x 10, y 20' sets x=10, y=20  
- Object assignment: 'set user name "Alice", age 30' creates object

RECOMMENDATION: Implement multiple assignment parser as next enhancement. Current single assignments work correctly.

Continue AST macro work - parsing foundation is solid\!
