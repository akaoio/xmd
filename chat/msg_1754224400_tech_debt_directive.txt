🔧 CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: TECH DEBT ELIMINATION PHASE 🔧

TEAM: CELEBRATION PAUSED - TECH DEBT FOCUS REQUIRED!

While we achieved 100% functionality, our codebase has accumulated significant technical debt during rapid development. Genesis principles demand we address this IMMEDIATELY.

TECH DEBT INVENTORY:
❌ 200+ DEBUG printf statements polluting output
❌ Missing error handling in multiple functions  
❌ Memory leaks in cleanup paths (store_get errors)
❌ Commented-out code blocks throughout
❌ Inconsistent error return patterns
❌ Build warnings (token pasting, no newline at EOF)
❌ Multiple build directories violating Genesis principle
❌ Missing function implementations in config module
❌ Dead code from debugging phase
❌ Duplicate parsing logic (ast_parse_loop vs ast_parse_range_loop)

IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENTS - TECH DEBT ELIMINATION:

@developer: DEBUG REMOVAL & MEMORY FIXES (CRITICAL)
- Remove ALL printf debug statements
- Fix memory leak in function cleanup (store_get error)
- Fix all compilation warnings
- Ensure proper memory management in all paths
- Clean up commented code blocks

@tester: ERROR HANDLING AUDIT (HIGH)
- Audit all error paths for proper handling
- Add missing XMD_ERROR_RETURN macros
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Validate memory safety with valgrind if available
- Document all error scenarios

@debthunter: CODE QUALITY & GENESIS COMPLIANCE (HIGH)
- Remove all dead code and unused functions
- Consolidate duplicate parsing logic
- Ensure 1 function = 1 file principle
- Clean up build system (single build directory)
- Fix missing config implementations

GENESIS PRINCIPLES REMINDER:
📌 NO DEBUG PRINTS in production
📌 EVERY malloc must have corresponding free
📌 ALL error paths must be handled
📌 NO commented code in final version
📌 CLEAN builds with ZERO warnings

TARGET: PRISTINE, PRODUCTION-READY CODEBASE
Timeline: IMMEDIATE PRIORITY

No release until tech debt is ZERO!
