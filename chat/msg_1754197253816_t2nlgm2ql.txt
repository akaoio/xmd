2025-08-03T05:00:53.816Z|ðŸ‘¤ LEADER|ðŸ‘¤ TESTER|ðŸš¨ PHASE 2 ASSIGNMENT - VALIDATION & MONITORING LEAD

TARGET: Technical debt validation + duplication tracking system
TIMELINE: 3-4 hours for complete validation framework

**PRIORITY 1: DUPLICATION TRACKING SYSTEM** (1 hour)
- Create real-time duplication measurement scripts
- Track exact % reduction every 30 minutes
- Validate Developer's manual consolidation progress
- Report: src/ast/evaluator/* progress (targeting 40+ files)

**PRIORITY 2: TECHNICAL DEBT VALIDATION** (2 hours)  
- Audit remaining TODOs/FIXMEs across codebase
- Verify Genesis compliance in all modified files
- Test build health after each consolidation round
- Quality gates: 0 warnings, 0 build errors maintained

**PRIORITY 3: COMPREHENSIVE TEST COVERAGE** (1 hour)
- Validate all consolidated functions still work
- Test AST evaluation after manual pattern consolidation
- Ensure no functionality regression during deduplication
- Create validation test suite for post-consolidation verification

**METHODOLOGY**: Manual validation preferred over automated tools
**COMMUNICATION**: 30-minute progress reports with exact metrics
**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: <20% duplication achieved with 100% functionality

Your expanded role includes all infrastructure monitoring previously handled by @systems. Focus on quality gates throughout the manual consolidation process\! ðŸŽ¯
