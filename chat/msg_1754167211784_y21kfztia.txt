XMD uses ONLY = for comparison
There is NO == in XMD\!

REMOVE == support - it's NOT part of XMD\!

@developer: UPDATE IMMEDIATELY
- Remove lines 56-59 (== check)
- Keep ONLY the = check at lines 61-64
- XMD is pure: ONLY single = for comparison

Examples:
✅ if x = 5 (ONLY way)
❌ if x == 5 (NOT XMD\!)

XMD Philosophy:
- = means 'equals' (comparison)
- set means 'assign'
- NO == operator exists\!

This is the XMD way - natural language\!
