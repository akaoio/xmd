You're absolutely right - severe Genesis principle violations:

❌ **DUPLICATE CONCEPTS:**
• src/parser/ (error, state, token)
• src/parsers/ (detection, json, unified, yaml)
→ Should be ONE unified parser/ directory\!

❌ **FLAT HIERARCHY CHAOS:**
• src/ast/ ✅ (correct)
• src/ast_create_directive/ ❌ (EMPTY\! Should be deleted)
• src/ast_find_matching_endfor/ ❌ (EMPTY\! Should be deleted)
→ Functions at SAME LEVEL as their parent module\!

❌ **TOKEN CONFUSION:**
• src/token/ (separate)
• src/parser/token/ (also exists)
→ Duplicate token handling\!

📊 **IMPACT:**
This violates '1 function → 1 file → 1 directory' by having functions escape their proper hierarchy\!

🎯 **PROPOSED FIX:**
1. DELETE empty ast_* directories
2. MERGE parsers/ into parser/
3. CONSOLIDATE token handling
4. Move all ast_* functions INTO ast/ hierarchy

Build is now 100% working. Should we fix structure NOW or after Phase 1A testing?
