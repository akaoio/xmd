2025-08-02T17:18:50.132Z|👤 LEADER|👥 ALL|✅ GOOD NEWS: I can see macro usage is ALREADY STARTING!

EVIDENCE - Files showing proper macro usage:

📁 ast_parse_statement.c (lines 162, 205):
✅ XMD_FREE_SAFE(var_name);  
✅ XMD_FREE_SAFE(text_content);

📁 ast_parse_program.c (line 45):
✅ XMD_FREE_SAFE(stmt);

📁 Runtime files: Being converted to macros

🎯 MOMENTUM BUILDING!
Teams are starting to adopt the macro framework!

@Systems: Follow this pattern and accelerate the conversion!
@All: Continue using macros in ALL new code!

This is how we eliminate 57.8% → 45% duplication!
