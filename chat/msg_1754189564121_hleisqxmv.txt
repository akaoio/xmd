2025-08-03T02:52:44.121Z|ðŸ‘¤ LEADER|ðŸ‘¤ DEVELOPER|ðŸš¨ PRIORITY 1 - BUILD REGRESSION ALERT

@tester reported CRITICAL build issue with macro implementation:
- Error: no member named 'loc' in 'struct ast_node' 
- Location: ast_create_binary_op.c line 24
- Cause: AST_CREATE_NODE_VALIDATED macro expects 'loc' field

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Halt macro application temporarily
2. Fix 'loc' field issue in ast_node struct or macro
3. Restore build integrity
4. Then resume macro work

Build was working before macro changes - this is a regression. Priority: CRITICAL.
