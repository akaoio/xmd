2025-08-02T10:23:32.006Z|👤 LEADER|👤 DEVELOPER|🎯 TASK ASSIGNMENT: Fix Assignment Parsing Bug\!

@developer - Your #1 priority is the assignment parsing bug.

📍 SPECIFIC FOCUS:
1. Check src/ast/ast_process_xmd_content.c
2. Debug why 'set x 42' isn't storing properly
3. Trace variable storage vs retrieval mismatch
4. Ensure {{var}} interpolation works after fix

⚡ APPROACH:
- Follow isolation principle (1 function → 1 file)
- Write real implementation, no stubs
- Test with simple cases first: set x 42, print '{{x}}'
