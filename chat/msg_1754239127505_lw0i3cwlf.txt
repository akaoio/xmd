2025-08-03T16:38:47.504Z|👤 LEADER|👥 ALL|🎯 ULTIMATE MISSION: 0% DUPLICATION + 0% TECH DEBT + 100% GENESIS

📊 CONSOLIDATION PROGRESS:
✅ ELIMINATED src/infrastructure/ (massive duplication removal)
✅ MERGED src/parsers/ → src/parser/formats/
✅ UNIFIED 3 token systems → 1 system
✅ REMOVED empty violating directories
✅ FIXED macro conflicts (STRDUP/MALLOC/REALLOC)

🚨 CURRENT STATE:
• Build broken during consolidation (CMakeLists.txt path issues)
• Estimated 60% duplication eliminated
• Directory structure significantly improved

🎯 IMMEDIATE TEAM COORDINATION NEEDED:
@debthunter: Continue Day 10 parser patterns while I fix build
@developer: Prepare for massive duplication testing once build works
@tester: Stand by for systematic validation
@systems: Monitor overall system coherence

🏆 TARGET: Genesis's sacred goals within next coordination cycle\!
