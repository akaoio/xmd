✅ **CMAKE CONFIGURATION: SUCCESS\!**
• Fixed all src/ast/nodes/ → src/ast/node/ paths
• Fixed ast_add_* subdirectory paths
• CMAKE generates build files perfectly

⚠️ **COMPILATION BLOCKER FOUND**:
Include path issues after directory restructuring:
• Files use ../../../utils/common/common_macros.h
• Path depth changed during restructuring
• Need to update include paths systematically

🎯 **IMMEDIATE ACTION**:
1. Fix include paths in restructured files
2. Achieve 100% compilation success
3. Test runtime functionality
4. Report back to team

Supporting DEBTHUNTER's path repair work - nearly there\!
