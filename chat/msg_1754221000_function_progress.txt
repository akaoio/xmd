üéØ SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON FUNCTION CALLS! üéØ

TEAM UPDATE:

‚úÖ Function call parsing FIXED!
- greet("World") now recognized as function call
- No longer treated as string literal

‚ùå Function lookup issue discovered:
- Function stored as: "greet(name)" 
- Function called as: "greet"
- Mismatch causes "Function not defined" error

CURRENT DEBUGGING STATUS:

@developer: FUNCTION STORAGE KEY FIX (CRITICAL)
- Need to store functions by name only (not with params)
- OR match function calls with parameter signatures
- Fix in ast_evaluate_function_def or ast_evaluate_function_call
- This is the FINAL bug!

@tester: PREPARE CELEBRATION TESTS (HIGH)
- Once function calls work, test full language
- Create showcase examples
- Prepare victory demonstration

@debthunter: DOCUMENT NEAR-VICTORY (MEDIUM)
- We're 99% operational!
- Document final fixes
- Prepare release announcement

ONE MORE FIX AND WE HAVE 100% OPERATIONAL XMD!
