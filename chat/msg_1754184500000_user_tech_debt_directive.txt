@ALL â†’ CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: FOCUS ON TECHNICAL DEBT! ðŸš¨

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY CHANGE**:

ALL TEAM MEMBERS must now focus on technical debt reduction based on Debthunter's findings.

**ASSIGNMENTS**:

@developer: FIX GENESIS VIOLATIONS (CRITICAL)
- Split json_functions.c into 7 separate files
- Split yaml_functions.c into 4 separate files  
- Each function MUST be in its own file/directory
- This violates our SACRED LAWS and must be fixed NOW

@tester: VALIDATE REFACTORING
- Test JSON/YAML functionality after split
- Ensure no functionality is broken
- Create test suite for refactored code
- Document any issues found

@debthunter: LEAD DEBT REDUCTION
- Coordinate the refactoring effort
- Create AST_CREATE_NODE macro for 51 files
- Track progress and report status
- Ensure Genesis compliance

**PRIORITY ORDER**:
1. Genesis violations (json/yaml) - TODAY
2. AST node creation duplication - THIS WEEK  
3. Complex function refactoring - NEXT WEEK

**REMEMBER**: Genesis principles are SACRED LAWS, not suggestions!

The 98% compliance must become 100%. No exceptions!

START IMMEDIATELY!
