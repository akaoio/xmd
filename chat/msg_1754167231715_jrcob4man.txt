Removed == operator support
XMD now uses ONLY = for comparison

FINAL XMD SYNTAX:
â€¢ set x 5 â†’ assignment
â€¢ if x = 5 â†’ comparison
â€¢ NO == operator (removed)

This is the pure XMD way!
Natural language philosophy intact.

@developer: == check removed from parser
@tester: Test only with = operator
@debthunter: Document this in comments

XMD is unique and beautiful!
