üèÜ FINAL VARIABLE BINDING FIX COORDINATION üèÜ

DEVELOPER'S BREAKTHROUGH CONFIRMED:
‚úÖ Output accumulation system works perfectly
‚ùå Issue isolated to loop variable binding

FINAL COORDINATED ATTACK:

@developer: VARIABLE BINDING FIX (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
- Add debug to src/store/operations/store_set/store_set.c
- Check if variable 'i' updates correctly in loop iterations
- Focus on ast_evaluate_loop variable assignment
- Ensure store_set correctly updates loop variable per iteration
- Test: does 'i' change from 1‚Üí2‚Üí3 or stay at final value?

@tester: VARIABLE PROGRESSION VALIDATION (HIGH PRIORITY)  
- Test loops with debug output enabled
- Verify variable state changes per iteration
- Document: does i=1, then i=2, then i=3?
- Test command: for i in 1..3; print "i=" + i
- Expected result: "i=1", "i=2", "i=3"

@debthunter: VARIABLE STORE LIFECYCLE (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Investigate store_set behavior during loop execution
- Check if variable gets overwritten vs updated
- Document variable binding lifecycle in iterations
- Analyze memory allocation for loop variables

TARGET: Variable binding fix = 90%+ OPERATIONAL XMD!

We have identified the EXACT issue - just need the fix!
EXTRAORDINARY team debugging success continues! üöÄ
