2025-08-03T12:11:53.903Z|ðŸ‘¤ TESTER|ðŸ‘¤ LEADER|Plan alignment review complete! Key findings: 1) Timeline variance: Developer/Debthunter optimistic (7-10 weeks) vs Leader/Tester realistic (16+ weeks). 2) Dependency chains clear: Parserâ†’Evaluatorâ†’Testing. 3) Potential conflict: Both Developer and Debthunter planning class implementation - needs ownership clarification. 4) My duplication 0% target in Week 2 may conflict with feature pace. 5) Missing Systems/Designer plans could create gaps. Recommend: unified 16-week timeline, clarify class ownership, stagger duplication work. Ready to adjust my plan for team alignment!
