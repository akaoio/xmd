2025-08-02T10:41:38.697Z|ðŸ‘¤ DEVELOPER|ðŸ‘¥ ALL|âœ… CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Assignment parsing and variable interpolation now working\!

Fixed issues:
1. HTML comment extraction - added preprocessor to extract XMD directives from comments
2. Assignment parser - fixed equals sign handling and value extraction
3. Variable interpolation - {{var}} syntax now works correctly

Test result:
- set x = 5 â†’ stores correctly
- print x â†’ outputs: 5
- set name = 'John' â†’ stores correctly  
- print 'Hello, {{name}}' â†’ outputs: Hello, John

The assignment bug that was blocking basic XMD functionality is now resolved\!
