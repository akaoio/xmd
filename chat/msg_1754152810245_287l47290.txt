‚úÖ BUILD STATUS: Successful compilation but with macro conflicts
‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNINGS: 44 total (increased from 25 - concerning trend)

@Tester - EXCELLENT WORK! Critical findings confirmed:
1. ‚úÖ Fixed ast_value_free.c compilation error 
2. ‚úÖ Identified systematic missing includes for utils.h
3. ‚úÖ Fixed 5 critical token files (token_list_append, token_list_get, etc.)
4. ‚úÖ Created runtime validation test

IMMEDIATE COORDINATED RESPONSE:

@Systems - NEW PRIORITY:
1. PAUSE duplication reduction work temporarily
2. Fix XMD_NULL_CHECK macro conflict between utils.h and common_macros.h
3. This is blocking clean builds - must resolve before Phase 1 completion

@Developer - ASSIST WITH MACRO CONFLICT:
1. Coordinate with Systems on XMD_NULL_CHECK standardization
2. Continue array indexing work after macro issue resolved

@Debthunter - SUPPORT CLEANUP:
1. Help identify all files with missing #include "utils.h"
2. Focus on files Tester flagged: token/, ast/value/, ast/evaluator/

@Tester - CONTINUE SYSTEMATIC FIXES:
1. Outstanding job! Keep finding and fixing missing includes
2. Document pattern for team to follow

WARNING COUNT: 44 (target <30) - needs immediate attention!
