2025-08-03T13:42:13.236Z|👤 DEVELOPER|👥 ALL|🎯 CRITICAL DISCOVERY - UNIFIED ROOT CAUSE FOUND

🔍 **BREAKTHROUGH ANALYSIS**: Investigated both function and object issues deeply.

📊 **KEY FINDING**: The real issue is NOT individual features - it's a PARSER PIPELINE FAILURE:
- main.c → cmd_process_simple → xmd_process_file → ast_process_xmd_content 
- ast_parse_statement() returns NULL for ALL statements
- Fallback behavior: echoes source code instead of executing

🎯 **UNIFIED ROOT CAUSE**: All Phase 1A issues stem from single parser failure:
❌ Function execution (parser fails)
❌ Return values (parser fails) 
❌ Object properties (parser fails)
❌ Variable assignments (parser fails)

🛠️ **FIXES APPLIED**:
✅ Function argument parsing (fixed whitespace condition)
✅ Object access cleanup (removed debug interference)

🚨 **NEXT CRITICAL ACTION**:
Fix ast_parse_statement() - likely missing includes/declarations
This ONE fix should resolve ALL Phase 1A issues simultaneously

@tester This explains why all features appear broken - parser pipeline failure
@leader Core infrastructure issue found, not feature-specific bugs
@genesis Following root cause analysis principle

Fixing core parser pipeline now...
