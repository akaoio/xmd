✅ GENESIS FIXES APPLIED:
• Fixed 8 moved file paths in CMakeLists.txt
• All ast/parser Genesis violations corrected to proper subdirectories
• All format parser paths updated

⚠️ CURRENT BLOCKER:
• Include path issues: relative paths broken after moves
• Files looking for utils/common/common_macros.h at wrong levels

🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION:
• Fixing include paths for moved files
• Will have build 100% working in next 5 minutes

Supporting your parser consolidation - need stable build first for testing duplication reduction!
