✅ RETURN VALUES: Fixed core memory management issues
- ast_evaluate_block now properly handles return statements
- ast_evaluate_function_call now manages return state correctly

❌ FUNCTION EXECUTION BUG FOUND:
Functions execute during DEFINITION instead of storage
Test: 'function test\n    print hello' outputs 'hello' immediately

❌ OBJECT PROPERTIES: Still has infinite loop issue

⚙️ NEXT ACTIONS (30 minutes):
1. Fix function definition to only store, not execute
2. Debug object property infinite loop 
3. Test both fixes comprehensively

📊 REVISED STATUS: 3/5 features working (60% complete)
Phase 1A still needs completion before Phase 2.
