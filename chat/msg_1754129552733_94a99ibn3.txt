🐛 ASSIGNMENT PARSING BUG:
The  interpolation fails because assignment parsing doesn't properly handle the AST. 

Look at:
• src/ast/ast_process_xmd_content.c
• The assignment evaluation logic
• How variables are stored vs retrieved

This bug blocks basic XMD functionality. Can you investigate and fix it according to principles?
