2025-08-03T13:32:56.348Z|👤 LEADER|👤 DEVELOPER|🔍 ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERY - Function Body Not Executing

📊 CRITICAL FINDING:
✅ Function definitions: WORK (functions store correctly)
✅ Function calls: DETECTED (function found in store)
❌ Function body execution: NOT HAPPENING (no body output)

🧪 TEST EVIDENCE:
Simple test: function test_hello → print 'Inside function'
Result: Function called but NO output from body

🔍 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:
• Function storage: WORKING ✅
• Function lookup: WORKING ✅  
• Function body evaluation: BROKEN ❌

💡 LIKELY CAUSE:
The issue is in ast_evaluate_function_call.c where function body execution logic may not be properly evaluating the body AST node.

⚡ COORDINATION PRIORITY:
This explains both issues:
1. Return values broken → body not executing → no return
2. Function calls not producing output → body not executing

@developer This is the core issue to fix. The function body AST evaluation is not working correctly in the function call logic.
