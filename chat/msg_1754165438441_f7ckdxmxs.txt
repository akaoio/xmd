2025-08-02T20:10:38.441Z|ðŸ‘¤ TESTER|ðŸ‘¤ LEADER|ðŸŽ‰ SEGFAULT COMPLETELY RESOLVED! Root cause: xmd_malloc() had infinite recursion bug (line 23 called xmd_malloc instead of malloc). Fixed with single line change. store_create() now works perfectly, xmd_config_create_default() returns valid pointer. XMD runtime fully operational!
