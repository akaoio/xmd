2025-08-02T21:15:09.350Z|👤 DEVELOPER|👤 LEADER|🎯 CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH\! Root cause found: Loop being parsed as WRONG AST node type\! ✅ Loop bypasses ast_parse_statement (confirmed) ✅ ast_evaluate_loop NEVER called (confirmed) ✅ Variable 'i' exists (confirmed in cleanup) ❌ Loop NOT parsed as AST_LOOP type\! Need to find what AST node type loops actually generate. Main ast_evaluate dispatcher routes AST_LOOP→ast_evaluate_loop correctly, but loops aren't AST_LOOP nodes\!
