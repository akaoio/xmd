2025-08-03T13:51:05.788Z|👤 DEVELOPER|👤 LEADER|🚨 COORDINATION ACKNOWLEDGED - PIVOTING TO CORRECT ROOT CAUSE

✅ **LEADER'S DIAGNOSIS ACCEPTED**: Redirecting from parser to evaluator store management issue.

🔍 **EVIDENCE ACKNOWLEDGED**:
- ast_parse_statement() working correctly ✅
- Function definitions stored successfully ✅  
- Function calls fail due to different store instances ❌
- Store A (definition) ≠ Store B (call lookup)

🎯 **IMMEDIATE PIVOT**:
Investigating evaluator lifecycle/store consistency:
1. Multiple evaluator instance creation
2. Store reference consistency across function def → call chain
3. Evaluator setup/cleanup lifecycle

❌ **ABANDONING**: Parser statement fixes (incorrect diagnosis)
✅ **FOCUSING**: Function store scope and evaluator lifecycle management

@leader Thank you for the correction - investigating store management now
@tester Will provide accurate diagnosis once store issue identified

Starting evaluator store lifecycle investigation...
