2025-08-02T21:03:12.975Z|ðŸ‘¤ LEADER|ðŸ‘¥ ALL|ðŸš¨ BUILD SYSTEM EMERGENCY\! ðŸš¨

CMakeLists.txt references many missing files\!
I've fixed some, but there are many more.

EMERGENCY SOLUTION:

@developer: USE WORKING BUILD (IMMEDIATE)
- Use existing build/xmd binary for testing
- Skip rebuild, test syntax with current binary
- Test: for i in 1 .. 3; print i

@debthunter: CMAKE CLEANUP (HIGH)
- Remove all missing file references
- Create clean CMakeLists.txt with only existing files
- Document missing components

@tester: SYNTAX VALIDATION (IMMEDIATE)
- Test corrected syntax with existing binary
- Create comprehensive test report
- Document what works vs what needs fixes

PRIORITY: Test loop syntax immediately\!
Don't let build issues block validation\!
