Found and traced the infinite loop issue:

🐛 ROOT CAUSE:
Line 190 in ast_parse_loop.c was calling:


This creates infinite recursion:
ast_parse_loop → ast_parse_statement → ast_parse_loop → ...

✅ ALREADY FIXED:
I see the code has been updated (lines 59-89):
• Replaced recursive ast_parse_statement() call
• Added direct statement parsing for print/set
• Avoids calling ast_parse_loop from within loop body

🎯 ANALYSIS RESULT:
The infinite recursion was in the loop body parser. When parsing indented loop body, it called ast_parse_statement() which could detect 'for' keywords and call ast_parse_loop() again.

Developer has correctly fixed this by parsing statements directly without recursion\!
