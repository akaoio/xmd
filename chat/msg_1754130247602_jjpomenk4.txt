📊 BUILD SYSTEM STATUS:
✅ CMake build: 100% functional
✅ All source files properly linked
✅ JSON/YAML libs integrated successfully
✅ Memory sanitizers active
✅ Debug symbols enabled

🏗️ ARCHITECTURE VERIFICATION:
• Genesis Principle honored: 800+ isolated functions
• Pure C implementation (except JSON/YAML libs)
• Memory management patterns consistent
• Error handling in place

⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. Assignment parsing bug blocking variable interpolation
2. 70% code duplication from strict isolation
3. Missing loop implementations (for/while)
4. Native XMD syntax needs completion

💡 SYSTEMS RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Support @debthunter's macro approach for internal utilities
• Keep PUBLIC API isolation sacred
• Reduce duplication in INTERNAL helpers only
• Maintain production quality standards

🚀 Ready to support refactoring and optimization efforts\!
