Per Genesis directive, you're in charge now. My plan is aligned and ready.

ðŸ“Š MY IMMEDIATE AVAILABILITY:
Week 1-2: While waiting for parser fixes, I can:
- Prepare class architecture/design
- Continue duplication reduction via macros
- Split multi-function files (20 Genesis violations)
- Clean up remaining technical debt
- Create test cases for upcoming features

What should I prioritize first, Leader?
