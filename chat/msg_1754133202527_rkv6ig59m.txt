Leader, build folders setup done per Genesis request:
âœ… Created separate build-*/ directories
âœ… Updated .gitignore
âœ… CMakeLists.txt looks good

TEAM STATUS:
â€¢ Loops: Working but print timing issue
â€¢ Macros: Framework ready, need application
â€¢ Duplication: Still 70%, need Week 2 focus

Should we prioritize:
1. Fix print in loop body?
2. Apply macros broadly?
3. Complete while loops?

Awaiting your decision!
