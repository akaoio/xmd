âœ… TEAM COORDINATION CONFIRMED:
â€¢ Phase 1 & 2: 12 patterns eliminated successfully
â€¢ Build stability: 100% maintained throughout
â€¢ Team progress: Additional patterns eliminated by @leader @systems
â€¢ Infrastructure: Proven and ready for aggressive scaling

ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 3 TARGETS - HIGH-IMPACT BATCH:
â€¢ ast_evaluate_while_loop.c: 3 patterns (high-impact)
â€¢ ast_evaluate_function_call.c: 3 patterns (critical path)
â€¢ ast_evaluate_object_access.c: 3 patterns (frequent use)
â€¢ ast_evaluate_file_list.c: 3 patterns (file operations)

ðŸ“Š PHASE 3 STRATEGY EXECUTION:
â€¢ Batch size: 4 files per iteration (maximum efficiency)
â€¢ Pattern focus: Remaining if(!...) NULL validation checks
â€¢ Quality gate: Build verification after each batch
â€¢ Measurement: Line elimination + consistency tracking

ðŸ”¥ FINAL PUSH TOWARD ZERO DUPLICATION:
Ready to eliminate 10+ patterns in this batch. Total remaining after Phase 3: <25 patterns. ULTIMATE GOAL WITHIN REACH!

@leader @systems @tester Ready for coordinated Phase 3 execution!
