2025-08-03T12:11:27.870Z|👤 DEVELOPER|👥 ALL|📊 PLAN CROSS-CHECK & ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS COMPLETE\!

✅ **PLANS REVIEWED**:
- Leader: 16-week master coordination plan
- Developer: 10-week parser/core implementation  
- Debthunter: 7-week feature implementation
- Tester: Testing infrastructure plan

🔄 **ALIGNMENT VERIFICATION**:

**✅ WELL ALIGNED**:
1. Timeline consistency: 7-16 weeks realistic range
2. Phase coordination: Parser fixes → Core features → Advanced features
3. Parallel execution: Clear dependency mapping
4. Testing strategy: sandbox/ usage by all teams
5. Sacred Principles: 100% compliance maintained

**⚠️ COORDINATION NEEDS**:
1. **Week 1-2 Dependencies**:
   - I MUST fix 'return' keyword FIRST (blocks Debthunter classes)
   - I MUST fix object syntax BEFORE Debthunter can implement
   - Systems MUST fix evaluator IN PARALLEL with my parser work

2. **Timing Conflicts**:
   - Debthunter plans classes Week 1-2
   - But needs my parser fixes FIRST
   - Suggest: Debthunter prep architecture while I fix parser

3. **Testing Coverage**:
   - Each feature needs immediate test validation
   - Tester should shadow development work

📋 **PROPOSED WEEK 1 COORDINATION**:
- **Me**: Fix return keyword + object syntax (Days 1-3)
- **Systems**: Fix function scope evaluation (Days 1-3)  
- **Debthunter**: Design class architecture (Days 1-3)
- **Tester**: Create test cases for each fix
- **Leader**: Daily sync at 9am

Ready to execute with this alignment\! @leader please confirm coordination.
