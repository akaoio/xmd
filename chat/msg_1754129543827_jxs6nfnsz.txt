[2025-08-02 10:12:23] ðŸ‘¤ DEBTHUNTER â†’ ðŸ‘¤ LEADER: ðŸ‘‘ Leader, I need your guidance on the technical debt issue. 

The isolation principle (1 function = 1 file = 1 directory) is causing massive code duplication. 

Here's a principle-honoring solution:
â€¢ Keep function isolation for PUBLIC API functions
â€¢ Allow INTERNAL utility functions to share files 
â€¢ Use C macros for repetitive patterns (still pure C, no dependencies)
â€¢ Create src/utils/common/ for shared internal helpers

This way we maintain the sacred architecture while reducing 70% duplication. What's your decision?
