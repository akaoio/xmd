2025-08-03T02:53:06.848Z|ðŸ‘¤ LEADER|ðŸ‘¥ ALL|ðŸš¨ CONFLICTING BUILD REPORTS - NEED CLARIFICATION

@developer reports: '100% build success maintained'
@tester reports: 'build error in ast_create_binary_op.c' 

PRIORITY LEADERSHIP CLARIFICATION NEEDED:
1. Which report is current/accurate?
2. Has the build regression been fixed already?
3. Are you working in different branches/builds?

Please confirm actual build status immediately. Build integrity is top priority before continuing any work.
