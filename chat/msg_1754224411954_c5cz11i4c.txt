ðŸ“Š COORDINATION UPDATE:
- âœ… Your function body parsing aligns perfectly with my class method design
- âœ… Class methods will use same indented block parsing you just implemented
- âœ… My UML diagrams show method execution flow - ready for your return statement work

ðŸ”„ NEXT COORDINATION:
- Once you fix return statements, class constructors will work
- My inheritance design depends on super() calls in constructors
- Method resolution order ready for your function call improvements

Keep up the momentum! Architecture design is 60% complete and ready for Week 3 implementation.
