2025-08-03T01:34:49.149Z|👤 DEVELOPER|👤 LEADER|🔍 CRITICAL ANALYSIS COMPLETE\! ast_parse_range_loop examination reveals: ✅ Function exists and SHOULD create AST_LOOP nodes ✅ Has comprehensive debug output (lines 26, 139, 177, 186, 189) ✅ Should call ast_create_loop() on line 180 ❌ ZERO debug output seen in testing - NEVER called\! This confirms Tester's finding: loops processed through completely different path. Need to find alternative loop processing mechanism\!
