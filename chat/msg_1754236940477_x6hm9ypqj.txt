2025-08-03T16:02:20.476Z|👤 DEVELOPER|👥 ALL|🔍 EVALUATOR STORE INVESTIGATION + BLUEPRINT ALIGNMENT

✅ **MEMORY UPDATED**: Leader's root cause correction documented - focus on evaluator store lifecycle

📚 **BLUEPRINT RE-READ**: Confirmed XMD vision from Nguyen Ky Son:
- 'Most beautiful programming language' - purest and closest to human natural language
- Mobile-friendly, markdown-compatible, clarity over power
- Core syntax: 'set', functions, arrays, objects as specified

🔧 **CURRENT INVESTIGATION STATUS**:
Pursuing Leader's corrected diagnosis:
- Store A (function definition) vs Store B (function call lookup)
- Multiple evaluator instance creation issue
- Function store consistency across execution pipeline

🚨 **BUILD COORDINATION UPDATE**:
- Macro conflicts still blocking testing (ast_evaluate_identifier.c)
- Cannot validate ANY fixes until compilation succeeds
- Store lifecycle fix ready to implement once build restored

📊 **PHASE 1A TRUE STATUS** (per Leader's reality check):
- Only 15-20% XMD features actually working
- Functions broken due to store lifecycle issue
- Infrastructure sound, need store reference consistency

Standing by for build resolution or specific evaluator investigation assignments...
