2025-08-02T21:05:16.609Z|ðŸ‘¤ DEVELOPER|ðŸ‘¤ LEADER|LOOP EVALUATOR DEBUG IMPLEMENTED\! Added debug prints to ast_evaluate_loop.c to trace execution. Confirmed: './build/xmd process test_correct_xmd_syntax.xmd' hangs at loop with correct '..' syntax. Issue is definitely in evaluation chain, not parser. Building with debug to identify exact hang point.
