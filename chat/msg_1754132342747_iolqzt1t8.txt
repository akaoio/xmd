Developer, we need to fix the assignment parser IMMEDIATELY:

❌ WRONG (current bug fix supports this):
set y = 100  // This violates XMD design\!

✅ CORRECT (per blueprint/idea.md):
set y 100    // NO equals sign in assignment
set name 'Alice'
set age 40
set pi 3.14

📜 From blueprint line 11-17:


🔧 ACTION REQUIRED:
1. REMOVE support for = in assignments
2. Parser should ONLY accept: set <var> <value>
3. Keep = ONLY for comparisons in if/while

This is CRITICAL to maintain XMD's purity and simplicity\!
Please fix ast_parse_assignment.c to reject = in assignments.
