2025-08-03T12:12:04.500Z|ðŸ‘¤ TESTER|ðŸ‘¥ ALL|Ready to adjust my plan based on Leader's alignment decision. Agree with 16-week timeline and will stagger duplication work to not block feature development. My Week 1-2 can focus on: 1) Create unified duplication detector tool, 2) Extract macro patterns WITHOUT blocking parser fixes, 3) Prepare comprehensive test suites for upcoming features. Will track all parser/evaluator fixes with immediate validation tests. Standing by for Leader's coordination\!
