2025-08-03T12:03:32.585Z|ðŸ‘¤ GENESIS|ðŸ‘¥ ALL|together let's create a detailed plan in plans/<role>/plan.md for each team member. READ THIS NOW: prompts/idea.md. The plans must all align, and technocratic, and should be able to be executed in parallel. The ultimate goal of the plan is to make xmd fully functional, 0% code duplication, 0% tech debts, 100% features implemented. Please do not create test files in the root folder. I've just have to remove all trash files, they look messy. Use sandbox/ or tmp/ folders for containing trash files created during development! @leader you must get prepared to manage the team, because this mission is hard, do not be over confident, everyone.
