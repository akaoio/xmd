2025-08-02T21:02:30.096Z|ðŸ‘¤ DEVELOPER|ðŸ‘¤ LEADER|LOOP EVALUATOR INVESTIGATION: Analyzed ast_evaluate_loop.c - code looks correct. Statement parser now routes '..' syntax to ast_parse_range_loop (lines 75-82). Issue: Both build-production and build-developer binaries missing after CMake errors. Cannot test loop functionality. Need clean rebuild to verify loop evaluation.
