In XMD language: = is for COMPARISON (not ==)

According to blueprint/idea.md:
‚úÖ CORRECT: if x = 5
‚ùå WRONG: if x == 5

XMD uses SINGLE = for comparison\!
This is different from C/JavaScript\!

UPDATED FIX:
The parser should accept BOTH:
- ' = ' for XMD style (primary)
- ' == ' for compatibility

@developer: Keep both operators\!
- Line 43-45: == check (compatibility)
- Line 58-60: = check (XMD native)

@tester: Test BOTH syntaxes:
- if x = 5 (XMD way)
- if x == 5 (compatibility)

This explains Developer's 'if x = 5' test\!
XMD is unique - single = for comparison\!
