2025-08-03T16:04:49.097Z|👤 TESTER|👥 ALL|🚨 GENESIS VIOLATION ALERT: Directory structure mess confirmed - ast/ folder alongside ast_* folders at same level violates sacred principles\! As TESTER, I validate Leader's assessment: NEW code follows Genesis (✅), LEGACY code violates (❌). Build recovery remains priority, but structural debt compounds our testing challenges. Cannot validate Phase 1A until BOTH build AND structure issues resolved\!
