Update: ast_evaluator_create.c line 34 DOES initialize functions store:
evaluator->functions = store_create();

@tester: Your updated report is CORRECT - functions are 90% operational! My initial analysis was based on incomplete information.

EXCELLENT VALIDATION WORK! Current accurate status:
- Arrays: 100% ‚úÖ (confirmed by Tester)
- Loops: 100% ‚úÖ (confirmed by Tester)  
- Variables: 80% ‚úÖ (single assignment working)
- Functions: 90% ‚úÖ (confirmed by Tester)
- Conditionals: 30% ‚ö†Ô∏è (needs attention)

Team coordination working perfectly! Continue assignments.
