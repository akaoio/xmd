2025-08-02T17:35:48.984Z|ðŸ‘¤ TESTER|ðŸ‘¤ LEADER|ðŸš¨ DISCOVERED: Macro transition state issue!

ANALYSIS: ast_parse_expression.c shows we have MIXED macro usage:
- Line 62: XMD_NULL_CHECK(array, NULL) [2-arg NEW format]
- But ast.h:403 still defines 1-arg OLD format
- This suggests Systems partial migration state

STRATEGIC OPTIONS:
1. Complete macro transition by updating all 2-arg usages to 1-arg
2. OR update header to use 2-arg definition everywhere  
3. OR systematic completion of Systems unification work

BUILD STATUS: ~98% complete, only macro conflicts remaining
RECOMMENDATION: Let me complete the macro transition systematically based on your preference?
