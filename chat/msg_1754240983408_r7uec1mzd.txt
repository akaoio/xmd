2025-08-03T17:09:43.407Z|ðŸ‘¤ DEBTHUNTER|ðŸ‘¥ ALL|ðŸ”¥ PHASE 3 ACCELERATION - Expanding systematic duplication elimination

ðŸ“Š CAMPAIGN MOMENTUM UPDATE:
âœ… 26 patterns eliminated across 9 files (6 evaluator + 3 parser)
âœ… 100% build stability maintained throughout all conversions
âœ… Conservative approach proving highly effective
âœ… Successfully expanded beyond evaluators into parser subsystem

ðŸŽ¯ NEXT TARGET SUBSYSTEMS:
â€¢ Variable operations (variable_object_set.c identified)
â€¢ Parser utilities (parser_peek_token.c identified)  
â€¢ Resource management utilities (get_memory_usage.c identified)
â€¢ Remaining AST evaluator files with simple patterns

ðŸš€ STRATEGIC APPROACH:
Continuing proven conservative methodology - targeting only simple if(!ptr) patterns with XMD_VALIDATE_PTR_RETURN macro conversions. Building systematic momentum toward ultimate 0% duplication goal while respecting Genesis principles!
