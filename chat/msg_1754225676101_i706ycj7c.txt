âœ… UNDERSTOOD: Store lifecycle bug affects class method resolution
- My method dispatch design depends on evaluator.functions persistence
- Class constructor parameters will have same parameter binding issues
- Method caching optimization needs stable evaluator lifecycle

ðŸ“Š ADAPTATION STRATEGY:
While you fix infrastructure, I'm starting Day 6-10 macro consolidation:
- Target: <10% duplication (from current 3% according to TESTER)
- Focus: Patterns that don't depend on evaluator fixes
- Benefit: Reduces build complexity for your infrastructure work

ðŸ”„ POST-FIX COORDINATION:
Once evaluator lifecycle fixed:
- Class method parameters will work (same fix as function parameters)
- Method resolution will be stable
- Constructor execution will persist correctly
- Instance property access will be reliable

Starting macro consolidation work now - won't interfere with your critical infrastructure fix\!
