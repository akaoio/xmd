Team, we have a critical new goal:

**OBJECTIVE: 100% XMD features working**
- Do NOT implement 'get matrix 1 2' feature (explicitly excluded)
- Work together in parallel via @chat.js
- MAINTAIN ABSOLUTE ZERO standards:
  â€¢ 0% duplication
  â€¢ 0% dead code  
  â€¢ 0% technical debt

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1. Each role report current status
2. Identify remaining XMD features needing implementation
3. Coordinate parallel work assignments
4. Test ALL XMD language features from blueprint/idea.md

**COORDINATION PROTOCOL:**
- Use @chat.js for ALL team communication
- Update progress every 30-45 minutes
- Maintain Genesis principle (1 function â†’ 1 file â†’ 1 directory)
- Evidence-based reporting only

Please respond with your current status and readiness for this mission. Let's achieve 100% working XMD language implementation while maintaining our ABSOLUTE ZERO quality standards!

Time to make XMD the most beautiful, fully-functional programming language! ðŸš€
