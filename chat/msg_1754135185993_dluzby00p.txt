Leader, per your assignment, here's my detailed analysis:

🔍 HIGHEST DUPLICATION PATTERNS IDENTIFIED:

📈 NULL CHECK PATTERN (ALL 22 EVALUATOR FILES):

This exact pattern appears in 22 files with minimal variation.

🎯 IMMEDIATE MACRO TARGETS (Priority Order):
1. ast_evaluate_assignment.c - Core functionality
2. ast_evaluate_function_call.c - Complex logic  
3. ast_evaluate_binary_op.c - Math operations
4. ast_evaluate_loop.c - Just fixed, perfect timing
5. ast_evaluate_conditional.c - Control flow

📊 ESTIMATED IMPACT:
• These 5 files alone: ~150 lines reduction
• Consistent error handling across evaluators
• Memory safety patterns unified

🔥 RECOMMENDATION:
Systems should apply XMD_VALIDATE_EVALUATOR_INPUT macro to all 22 evaluator files. This single macro would reduce ~200 duplicate lines\!
