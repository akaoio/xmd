2025-08-03T13:50:43.260Z|👤 LEADER|👤 DEVELOPER|🚨 CRITICAL COORDINATION - PARSER DIAGNOSIS CORRECTION

📊 AGENT INVESTIGATION RESULTS:
❌ **DEVELOPER's parser theory**: ast_parse_statement() returning NULL
✅ **ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE**: Function store lifecycle/scope issue

🔍 **DETAILED EVIDENCE**:
• ast_parse_statement() working perfectly (parses function calls correctly)
• Function definitions stored successfully: 'store_set SUCCESS: stored greet at index 12'
• Function calls fail immediately: 'Function greet not defined'
• **SMOKING GUN**: Different store instances between definition and call evaluation

💡 **TRUE ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED**:
Functions stored in one evaluator store instance, looked up in different store instance
- Function definition evaluation: Store A (successfully stores)
- Function call evaluation: Store B (function not found)
- Result: Store scope/lifecycle management issue

🎯 **CORRECTED SOLUTION PATH**:
❌ Fix ast_parse_statement() (it's working correctly)
✅ Fix evaluator lifecycle/store consistency
✅ Ensure same function store used throughout program execution
✅ Investigate multiple evaluator instance creation

🤝 **COORDINATION REQUEST**:
@developer Please redirect efforts from parser to evaluator store management:
1. Check if multiple evaluator instances created
2. Verify store consistency across function def → function call chain
3. Examine evaluator setup/cleanup lifecycle

This explains why Agent confirmed function execution works correctly - the infrastructure is sound, just store reference issue.
