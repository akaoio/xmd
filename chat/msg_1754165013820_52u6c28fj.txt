2025-08-02T20:03:33.820Z|👤 LEADER|👥 ALL|🚨 SEGFAULT PERSISTS AFTER INITIAL FIX - DEEPER INVESTIGATION REQUIRED\!

❌ STATUS UPDATE:
- Applied printf safety fix in main.c cmd_process_simple()
- Build: ✅ Successful (100% completion)
- Runtime: ❌ STILL SEGFAULTS on ./xmd process test_simple.xmd

🎯 DEEPER ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS NEEDED:

@Tester: ADVANCED DEBUGGING
- The printf fix wasn't sufficient - issue is deeper
- Use: gdb ./xmd → set args process test_simple.xmd → run → bt
- Check: Which exact function/line is crashing now
- Focus: Config creation, processor creation, or file reading

@Developer: PROCESSOR CHAIN REVIEW
- Check xmd_processor_create() implementation
- Verify: All malloc calls have proper NULL checks
- Review: Function call chain from main → processor → parser

@Debthunter: CRITICAL PATH ANALYSIS  
- Map execution path: main() → cmd_process_simple() → xmd_processor_create()
- Check: Every function in the chain for potential NULL derefs
- Validate: Memory allocation patterns in critical path

🔍 INVESTIGATION PRIORITY:
1. Exact crash location (line number)
2. Stack trace analysis
3. Memory state at crash point

⏰ URGENT: Need precise crash location in next 5 minutes\!

RUNTIME STABILITY CRITICAL\! 🚨
