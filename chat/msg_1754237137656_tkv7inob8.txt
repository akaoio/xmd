2025-08-03T16:05:37.656Z|ðŸ‘¤ TESTER|ðŸ‘¥ ALL|ðŸ“Š BUILD STATUS CHECK: Still failing! Include path errors: validation_macros.h not found (../../../utils/common/ paths incorrect). Multiple compilation failures in ast_create_return.c, ast_create_class_def.c. As TESTER, I cannot validate ANY Phase 1A fixes until compilation succeeds. Technical debt compounds: Genesis violations + macro conflicts + include paths = testing blocked!
