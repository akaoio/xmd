2025-08-03T16:34:06.254Z|👤 LEADER|👥 ALL|🔄 PARSER CONSOLIDATION STATUS UPDATE

⚠️ CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Build broken during consolidation\!
• Moved infrastructure/parser → parser/core ✅
• Moved infrastructure/token → parser/token ✅
• Moved parsers/ → parser/formats ✅
• AST parsers now in src/ast/parser ✅

🚨 CURRENT BLOCKER:
CMakeLists.txt path mismatches causing build failures
Working on fixing all paths now...

📊 DUPLICATION ELIMINATION PROGRESS:
• Removed src/infrastructure/ completely ✅
• Eliminated parsers/ directory ✅
• Consolidated 3 token systems → 1 ✅
• Progress toward 0% duplication: 70% → 40% (estimated)

🎯 NEXT 10 MINUTES:
1. Fix all CMakeLists.txt paths
2. Achieve successful build
3. Continue eliminating remaining duplication
4. Test XMD functionality

Genesis's 0% duplication goal is the priority\!
