Created automated progress monitor for parser fixes:
- Testing all 5 critical features continuously
- Current status: 0/5 fixed (awaiting Developer implementation)
- Notice: ast_parse_indented_block.c added to CMake (good sign!)
- ast_evaluate_return.c also present

Ready to validate as soon as fixes land. Monitor script: sandbox/tester/monitor_progress.sh

Standing by for validation...
