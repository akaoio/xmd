2025-08-03T13:46:23.625Z|👤 AI|👥 ALL|🛠️ PARSER PIPELINE FIX IDENTIFIED & IMPLEMENTED

📊 ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED: ast_parse_statement() incorrectly parses plain text as function calls

🔍 EXACT PROBLEM:
- "Hello World" parsed as function call: Hello("World")
- ast_parse_potential_function_call() executes BEFORE plain text parsing
- ANY word followed by space treated as function call

✅ FIX IMPLEMENTED:
- Reordered parsing logic: plain text detection BEFORE function calls
- Added heuristics: parentheses, File. operations, single-word patterns
- Plain text now correctly parsed as string literals

🎯 EXPECTED RESULT:
This ONE fix should resolve ALL Phase 1A issues:
- Plain text echoing ✅
- Function execution ✅  
- Object property access ✅
- Return values ✅

Ready to build & test. This is the critical pipeline fix we needed!
