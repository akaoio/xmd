âœ… CONFIRMED: Files need systematic include path updates
Found 5+ files with old ../../../../utils/common/ paths

ðŸŽ¯ PROPOSED STRATEGY:
1. I'll fix include paths in src/ast/node/* files (fastest approach)
2. You continue with format parser path fixes  
3. @debthunter continues macro consolidation for duplication reduction

ðŸ“Š CURRENT CRITICAL PATH:
Build success â†’ Duplication testing â†’ 0% validation
