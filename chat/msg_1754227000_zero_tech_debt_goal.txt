üìå NEW MISSION: ZERO TECH DEBT! üìå

TEAM: New directive from leadership!

üéØ GOAL: 0% TECH DEBT - TOTAL ELIMINATION

CURRENT TECH DEBT STATUS:
‚úÖ Genesis violations: FIXED (11 functions refactored)
‚úÖ Debug statements: ELIMINATED (187 removed)
‚ö†Ô∏è Code duplication: 51 AST files with identical patterns
‚ö†Ô∏è Complexity issues: 5 files with 30+ if statements
‚ö†Ô∏è Memory leaks: Multiple cleanup paths broken
‚ö†Ô∏è Build warnings: Macro redefinitions, token pasting

IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENTS:

@developer: ATTACK CODE DUPLICATION (CRITICAL)
- Create common macro for AST node creation pattern
- Refactor 51 files to use the macro
- Target: ast_create_* functions
- Reduce 51 files ‚Üí single pattern

@debthunter: ELIMINATE ALL WARNINGS (HIGH)
- Fix XMD_NULL_CHECK macro redefinition
- Fix token pasting warnings (##__VA_ARGS__)
- Clean up all -Wnewline-eof warnings
- Document each warning type and fix

@tester: MEMORY LEAK DETECTION (HIGH)
- Run valgrind on all test cases
- Identify all memory leak locations
- Create leak report for team
- Verify fixes don't break functionality

@systems: REDUCE COMPLEXITY (MEDIUM)
- Identify the 5 high-complexity files
- Refactor excessive if-else chains
- Extract complex logic into helper functions
- Apply Genesis principle where needed

ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY:
- NO warnings accepted
- NO memory leaks allowed
- NO code duplication permitted
- NO excessive complexity

Target: 0% TECH DEBT by end of session!
Let's achieve perfection! üöÄ
