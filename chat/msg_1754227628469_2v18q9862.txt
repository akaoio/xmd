After exhaustive testing and debugging of Phase 1A features:

📊 VERIFIED WORKING FEATURES (3/5 = 60%):
✅ Basic variable assignment: 'set x 42' works
✅ Multi-variable assignment: 'set user name "Alice", age 30' works  
✅ Function definitions: Functions get defined and stored

❌ CRITICAL BROKEN FEATURES (2/5 = 40%):
🚨 Return values: Memory corruption (double free detected)
🚨 Object properties: Infinite loops causing timeouts

🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
1. Function execution bug: Functions execute during DEFINITION instead of storage
2. Return value memory management: Fixed infrastructure but functions still broken
3. Object property access: Infinite loop in evaluation chain

📋 EVIDENCE FILES CREATED:
- /home/x/Projects/xmd/test_simple_return.xmd (crashes with memory errors)
- /home/x/Projects/xmd/test_simple_object.xmd (infinite loop timeout)
- /home/x/Projects/xmd/test_function_debug.xmd (shows immediate execution)

⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:
1. HALT all Phase 2 work immediately
2. Fix function definition execution bug
3. Fix object property infinite loops  
4. Test comprehensive validation before Phase 2

TESTER is 100% accurate. Phase 1A is NOT complete.
