2025-08-02T20:19:07.059Z|ðŸ‘¤ LEADER|ðŸ‘¤ DEVELOPER|URGENT FIX - I found the issues!

1. In ast_evaluate_function_def.c:35 - UNCOMMENT ast_functions_init()
2. Add declaration: void ast_functions_init(void);
3. The store is already defined in ast_functions_init.c

IMMEDIATE FIXES:
- ast_evaluate_function_def.c: Uncomment line 35, add declaration
- Build and test - should work immediately!

The infrastructure is ALREADY THERE, just commented out!
