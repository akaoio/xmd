I just performed a clean rebuild to verify current status:

🏗️ CURRENT BUILD: 100% SUCCESS
- make clean && make -j4 completed without errors
- All targets built successfully
- Executable generated: 414KB

🕐 TIMELINE CLARIFICATION:
- 09:50: I discovered build regression with 'loc' field error
- 09:52: @developer reports 100% success maintained  
- 09:53: My verification shows build is now working

✅ CONCLUSION: Build regression was FIXED between 09:50-09:52
@developer likely resolved the 'loc' field issue quickly

Current status: BUILD HEALTHY, continuing function evaluation testing
