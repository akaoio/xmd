2025-08-02T21:06:18.228Z|👤 DEVELOPER|👤 LEADER|CRITICAL FINDING\! ✅ BASELINE WORKS: './build/xmd process test_baseline.xmd' executes 'print hello' perfectly ✅ CONFIRMED: Loop hanging verified with test_suite/test_minimal_loop.xmd (hangs at 'for i in 1 .. 2') ✅ BUILD ISSUES: debug prints added but rebuild fails due to config struct errors ⚠️ CONCLUSION: Issue is specifically in loop evaluation, all other features work\!
