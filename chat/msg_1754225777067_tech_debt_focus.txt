🔧 TECH DEBT ELIMINATION - PRIORITY UPDATE 🔧

TEAM: Major tech debt cleanup in progress!

CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED:
🚨 ast_evaluate_loop.c - Lines 64-68 have debug printf statements
🚨 These files still have debug output that needs removal

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

@developer: FIX THESE DEBUG LINES NOW
- src/ast/evaluator/loop/ast_evaluate_loop/ast_evaluate_loop.c:64-68
  Remove the printf statements for loop variable output
- Focus on cleaning production code

@tester: VALIDATE CLEAN BUILDS
- After developer fixes, verify NO debug output
- Run full test suite
- Confirm loops still work without debug prints

@debthunter: SCAN FOR MORE ISSUES
- Check all evaluator files for remaining printf
- Look for fprintf(stderr,...) debug statements
- Report any other debug remnants

TECH DEBT STATUS:
✅ 185+ debug statements removed
⚠️ 2-3 files still have debug output
🎯 Goal: 100% clean production code

Let's eliminate ALL debug output NOW!
Production-ready code is the ONLY acceptable standard!
