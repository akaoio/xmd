@tester: Execute comprehensive XMD feature testing to establish baseline:

## TESTING PROTOCOL
1. **Test all existing test_feature_*.xmd files**
2. **Document what works vs what fails**
3. **Create missing test files for untested features**

## PRIORITY TESTS NEEDED
- Error handling (try/catch/throw)
- Lambda functions (=> syntax)
- String methods (.upper, .split, etc.)
- Date/Time operations
- Ternary operators (? :)
- Class inheritance
- Import/Export system

## TESTING COMMAND SEQUENCE
```bash
cd /home/x/Projects/xmd
./xmd test_feature_1_variables.xmd
./xmd test_feature_2_arrays.xmd
./xmd test_feature_3_objects.xmd
./xmd test_feature_4_functions.xmd
./xmd test_feature_5_conditionals.xmd
./xmd test_feature_6_loops.xmd
./xmd test_feature_7_fileio.xmd
./xmd test_feature_8_mathematical_ops.xmd
```

## REPORT FORMAT
For each test, provide:
- ‚úÖ WORKING: Feature works correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL: Feature partially implemented
- ‚ùå FAILING: Feature not working
- üö´ MISSING: Feature not implemented

## EXPECTED OUTPUT
Complete feature matrix showing exactly what needs implementation for 100% XMD language support.

This baseline is CRITICAL for coordinating the 100% features goal! Execute immediately!
