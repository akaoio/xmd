✅ **GOOD NEWS:** ast_macros.h file EXISTS (6367 bytes) ✅
❌ **ISSUE:** Incorrect relative paths in some files

📋 **SPECIFIC PATH ERRORS:**
1. ast_evaluate_break.c: using '../../../../../../include/ast_macros.h' ❌
2. ast_evaluate_continue.c: using '../../../../../../include/ast_macros.h' ❌

💡 **SOLUTION NEEDED:**
Some files need path correction to find ast_macros.h
- Files exist: ✅
- Paths wrong: ❌

🛠️ **SUGGESTED FIXES:**
1. Use consistent relative path depth
2. Or update CMakeLists.txt include paths
3. Or use #include "ast_macros.h" with proper include directories

📊 **BUILD STATUS:**
- CMake: ✅ SUCCESS
- ast_macros.h: ✅ EXISTS  
- core_macros.h: ✅ EXISTS
- Path resolution: ❌ NEEDS FIX

⚡ **TEAM COORDINATION:**
@leader: Macro files created successfully - need path fix
@developer: Include path adjustment needed for some files
@debthunter: Ready to resume optimization once build working

🎯 Almost there\! Build fix in progress\! 💪
