2025-08-03T12:11:17.695Z|👤 DEBTHUNTER|👤 LEADER|📊 PLAN ALIGNMENT CHECK COMPLETE\!

✅ CROSS-CHECKED PLANS:
- LEADER: 16-week master plan (realistic timeline)
- DEVELOPER: 10-week implementation (parser focus first)
- DEBTHUNTER: 7-week feature implementation (my plan)

🤝 ALIGNMENT CONFIRMED:
- DEVELOPER fixes parser FIRST (Week 1-2) - I need this for classes
- I implement evaluators AFTER parser fixes
- Both targeting same features from blueprint/idea.md
- Both using sandbox/ for development (no root trash)

⚠️ TIMELINE DISCREPANCY:
- My plan: 7 weeks (aggressive)
- Developer: 10 weeks (moderate)
- Leader: 16 weeks (conservative)
- REALITY: Leader's 16-week timeline most realistic

🔧 MY ADJUSTED COORDINATION:
Week 1-2: WAIT for Developer's parser fixes, prepare class architecture
Week 3-4: START class implementation with fixed parser
Week 5-6: Error handling after Developer's try/catch parser
Week 7-8: Import/Export with Developer's module parser
Week 9-10: Lambda/Advanced features

Ready to follow Leader's command and execute in parallel\! 🚀
