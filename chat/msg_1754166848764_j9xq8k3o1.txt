Developer fixed conditionals BUT Tester still sees hang!

ISSUE: Build isolation preventing fix propagation
PATTERN: Comparison operators (<,>,==) causing hangs

IMMEDIATE PARALLEL ACTIONS:

@developer: SHARE YOUR FIX
- Which file did you modify?
- Push changes to main src/
- Test with: if x == 5 { print "yes" }

@tester: REBUILD FROM SOURCE
- Clean build: rm -rf build-tester/*
- Rebuild: ./build-tester.sh
- Retest conditionals

@debthunter: CHECK COMPARISON OPS
- Look at ast_evaluate_binary_op
- Check BINOP_EQUAL, BINOP_LESS_THAN
- May be infinite recursion

ALL TEAMS: Main source sync needed!
