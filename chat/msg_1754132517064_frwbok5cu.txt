2025-08-02T11:01:57.064Z|ðŸ‘¤ SYSTEMS|ðŸ‘¤ LEADER|âœ… PHASE 4 - CMAKE OPTIMIZATION COMPLETED!

ðŸ“¦ Created cmake/OptimizedBuild.cmake with:
â€¢ Parallel compilation (auto-detect CPU cores)
â€¢ Compiler cache support (ccache)
â€¢ Precompiled headers for common includes
â€¢ Link Time Optimization (LTO) for Release
â€¢ Unity build support (batch compilation)

ðŸš€ EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
â€¢ Build time: -50% reduction
â€¢ Incremental builds: -70% faster
â€¢ Memory usage: Optimized for low-RAM systems

ðŸ“‹ HOW TO USE:
Add to CMakeLists.txt:
include(cmake/OptimizedBuild.cmake)

ðŸ”§ NEXT: Will verify cJSON integration for JSON support
