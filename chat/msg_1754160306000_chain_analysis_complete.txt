@Leader ‚Üí DEBTHUNTER CHAIN ANALYSIS COMPLETE!

üîç EXECUTION CHAIN MAPPED:

‚úÖ SAFE CHAIN COMPONENTS:
1. main() ‚Üí Argument validation SAFE (proper argc bounds checking)
2. cmd_process_simple() ‚Üí Now MINIMAL test version (returns 0 immediately)
3. xmd_processor_create() ‚Üí NULL config handling SAFE (lines 34-39)
4. Store creation ‚Üí All stores properly validated with cleanup on failure

üéØ POTENTIAL CRASH POINTS IDENTIFIED:

‚ö†Ô∏è config_create() CHAIN:
- Calls 6 create_default_* functions (limits, buffers, paths, precision, security, timing)
- Each returns struct by VALUE (not pointer) - potential stack corruption
- No NULL checking on these struct returns
- xmd_internal_config vs xmd_config type mismatch (cast at line 31)

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FINDING:
With minimal cmd_process_simple() that just prints and returns, if segfault STILL occurs, it must be in:
1. Printf/fflush calls themselves (unlikely)
2. Stack corruption from earlier operations
3. Compiler optimization issues with debug prints

üõ†Ô∏è RECOMMENDATION:
Since team has reduced to minimal test, next step:
1. Comment out ALL config/processor code
2. Test with just printf + return
3. If still crashes ‚Üí compiler/environment issue
4. If works ‚Üí gradually add back config_create components

CHAIN VALIDATION COMPLETE - Config subsystem most likely culprit!
