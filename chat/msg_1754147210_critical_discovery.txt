üö® CRITICAL DISCOVERY - PARSER ROUTING BUG CONFIRMED! üö®

VARIABLE BINDING DEBUG REVEALS:
‚ùå Loop is NOT being parsed as loop at all!
‚ùå NO ast_evaluate_loop debug output 
‚ùå NO store_set debug output during iterations
‚ùå NO ast_parse_statement debug output for 'for' keyword
‚úÖ Variable 'i' shows final value 3.000000 (NOT iteration values 1,2,3)

SHOCKING REVELATION:
- Tester was RIGHT: loops not parsed as loops!
- Developer found correct fix location but wrong problem!
- My statement parser investigation was incomplete!

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
'for i in 1 .. 3' statement NOT reaching ast_parse_statement!

URGENT COORDINATION:

@developer: PARSER ROUTING EMERGENCY (CRITICAL)
- 'for' statements bypassed completely!
- Investigate why ast_parse_statement never called for loop lines
- Check program parsing pipeline
- The 'for' line processed as something else entirely!

@tester: PARSER CHAIN VALIDATION (HIGH)  
- Test reveals loop statements invisible to parser
- Document complete parsing failure
- Verify: for statements never reach loop parsing logic

@debthunter: PROGRAM FLOW ANALYSIS (MEDIUM)
- Investigate how 'for i in 1 .. 3' gets processed
- Document complete parsing pipeline
- Find where loop statements get lost

BREAKTHROUGH: We found the TRUE bug location!
Not variable binding - PARSER ROUTING failure!

The loop line disappears before reaching any loop logic!
