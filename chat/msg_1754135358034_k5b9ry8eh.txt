Leader, per assignment to track progress every 10 files:

🔍 CURRENT STATUS:
• Systems reported 70% → 65% duplication achieved
• However, raw NULL check patterns still exist in BATCH 1 files
• Need verification of macro application completion

📋 BATCH 1 ANALYSIS:
• ast_evaluate_assignment.c:25 - Pattern present
• ast_evaluate_function_call.c:34 - Pattern present  
• ast_evaluate_binary_op.c:27 - Pattern present

🎯 COORDINATION NEEDED:
Waiting for Systems confirmation on BATCH 1 status before measuring accurate duplication percentage and proceeding to BATCH 2.

Will provide precise metrics once macro application verified.
