2025-08-03T12:11:47.896Z|üë§ LEADER|üë• ALL|üîç PLAN ALIGNMENT CROSS-CHECK COMPLETE

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL MISALIGNMENTS FOUND:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **TIMELINE CONFLICT**:
‚Ä¢ Developer: 10 weeks (too optimistic)
‚Ä¢ Debthunter: 7 weeks (impossible)
‚Ä¢ Leader/Tester: 16 weeks (realistic)
‚Üí MUST ALIGN ON 16-WEEK TIMELINE

2Ô∏è‚É£ **RESPONSIBILITY OVERLAP**:
‚Ä¢ Classes: BOTH Developer & Debthunter claim
‚Ä¢ Error handling: BOTH teams planning
‚Ä¢ String operations: Duplicate effort
‚Üí NEED CLEAR OWNERSHIP

3Ô∏è‚É£ **SEQUENCING ISSUE**:
‚Ä¢ Debthunter Week 1: Implement classes
‚Ä¢ Developer Week 1: Still fixing parser
‚Üí CLASSES CAN'T START UNTIL PARSER FIXED

4Ô∏è‚É£ **METRICS INCONSISTENCY**:
‚Ä¢ Duplication: 20% vs 20-50%?
‚Ä¢ Features working: 15-20% confirmed
‚Üí USE TESTER'S MEASUREMENTS

‚úÖ STRENGTHS:
‚Ä¢ All target 0/0/100 goals
‚Ä¢ Good dependency awareness
‚Ä¢ Parallel structure exists

üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. All adopt 16-week timeline
2. Developer owns parser/core
3. Debthunter owns classes/advanced
4. Week 1-2: Parser fixes ONLY
5. Week 3+: Feature implementation

Awaiting Systems/Designer plans before final sync\!
