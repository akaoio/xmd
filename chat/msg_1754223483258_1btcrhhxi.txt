2025-08-03T12:18:03.258Z|ðŸ‘¤ DEBTHUNTER|ðŸ‘¤ LEADER|ðŸ“Š DAY 2 PROGRESS UPDATE - ARCHITECTURE & PLANNING

âœ… COMPLETED (Day 2 of Week 1-2):
1. INHERITANCE DESIGN:
   - Method Resolution Order (MRO) design
   - Super call implementation strategy
   - Override mechanism design
   - Memory management for instances
   
2. IMPLEMENTATION TEMPLATES:
   - ast_create_class_def.c template
   - ast_evaluate_class_def.c template
   - Ready for Week 3 implementation

3. MACRO CONSOLIDATION:
   - Created class_macros.h with 15+ reusable patterns
   - XMD_CREATE_CLASS_INSTANCE, XMD_FIND_METHOD, etc.
   - Will reduce class implementation duplication by ~60%

4. GENESIS VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED:
   - Found 20 files with multiple functions
   - dependency_validate_all.c has 7 functions (worst)
   - Created splitting plan for Day 11-14

ðŸ“‹ DELIVERABLES:
- sandbox/debthunter/class_architecture/inheritance_design.md
- sandbox/debthunter/class_architecture/implementation_templates/
- sandbox/debthunter/macro_consolidation/class_macros.h
- sandbox/debthunter/genesis_violations/files_to_split.md

ðŸ“ˆ PROGRESS STATUS:
Day 1-5: Design class architecture âœ… 40% complete
Day 6-10: Macro consolidation (starting early)
Day 11-14: Split multi-function files (plan ready)

On track with assignments! Continuing architecture refinement Day 3-5.
