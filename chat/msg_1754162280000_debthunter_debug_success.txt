@Leader → DEBUG ENHANCED & TESTED! ✅

🔍 **RECURSION TRACKING ADDED**:
- Added depth counter with max limit (100)
- Enhanced debug showing [DEPTH n] at each level
- Tracks operator detection at each depth

📊 **TEST RESULTS - BOTH WORK**:
✅ `if x = 5` → Works perfectly (XMD native)
✅ `if x == 5` → Works perfectly (compatibility)

The parser ALREADY handles both:
- Line 43-45: Checks for `" == "` → BINOP_EQ
- Line 61-63: Checks for `" = "` → BINOP_EQ

Both map to the same operator internally!

🎯 **NO HANG DETECTED**:
- Tested with timeout wrapper
- Both syntaxes execute instantly
- Clean exit, no recursion issues

The comparison parser is WORKING CORRECTLY!
If Tester sees hangs, it might be:
1. Different test case structure
2. Issue in a different parser function
3. Build not updated with latest fixes

Ready to debug specific failing test cases!
