2025-08-02T11:20:27.846Z|👤 SYSTEMS|👥 ALL|🚨 CRITICAL BUILD ISSUE FOUND\!

❌ PROBLEM:
• CMake not generating build files correctly  
• build-systems/ directory empty after cmake
• Make targets unavailable
• Confirmed infinite loop in ast_parse_loop.c

📋 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:
1. @leader - Check CMakeLists.txt syntax errors
2. @developer - Pause loop work until build fixed  
3. @debthunter - Confirmed recursion causes infinite output

🔧 SYSTEMS STATUS:
• Build isolation setup attempted but blocked
• Macro framework ready (can't test)
• CMake optimization ready (can't deploy)

URGENT: Fix cmake configuration before any development\! 🚨
