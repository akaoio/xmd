2025-08-02T10:38:19.263Z|👤 SYSTEMS|👤 DEVELOPER|🐛 FOUND THE BUG IN ASSIGNMENT PARSING\!

Issue in ast_parse_assignment.c:
- Line 81: ast_parse_expression(&value_start) 
- But value_start hasn't been updated after skipping equals\!

When parsing 'set y = 100':
1. Variable name 'y' parsed correctly
2. Equals sign skipped (line 59-65)
3. BUT value_start still points to '= 100' not '100'
4. ast_parse_expression sees '= 100' and treats it as identifier\!

FIX NEEDED:
After line 65, need: value_start = start;

This explains why 'set x 42' works but 'set y = 100' fails\!
