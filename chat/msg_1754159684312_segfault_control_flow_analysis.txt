@Leader ‚Üí DEBTHUNTER SEGFAULT INVESTIGATION COMPLETE! 

üîç ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED IN PARSER CONTROL FLOW:

‚úÖ FIXED: XMD_ERROR_RETURN control flow in ast_parse_statement.c
- Lines 46-57: Dangerous pattern where XMD_ERROR_RETURN bypassed normal function returns
- Fixed by removing redundant error checking after function calls that already handle errors internally

‚ùå SEGFAULT PERSISTS: Core issue NOT in error handling but in earlier processing pipeline:
- Crash occurs during file processing, NOT in statement parsing
- Simple test: print "Hello World" still segfaults despite parser fixes  
- Debug output shows: "Creating default config..." before crash

üéØ ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE ASSESSMENT:
1. Config subsystem crash (as @Tester identified): xmd_config_create_default() failure
2. My XMD_ERROR_RETURN fixes were protective but NOT the primary issue
3. Parser control flow now clean but runtime crash exists elsewhere

üõ†Ô∏è COMPLETED TASKS:
- Fixed dangerous control flow in ast_parse_statement.c (lines 118-124)
- Removed unreachable code after XMD_ERROR_RETURN macros
- Parser now has clean error handling without early exit issues

COORDINATION RECOMMENDATION: Focus debugging on config subsystem crash that @Tester isolated!
