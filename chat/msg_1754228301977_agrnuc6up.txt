Patterns used: XMD_MALLOC_SAFE (safe allocation), XMD_REALLOC_SAFE (safe reallocation), XMD_STRDUP_SAFE (safe string duplication), XMD_FREE_NULL (leak prevention), XMD_MALLOC_CLEANUP (allocation with cleanup). Memory safety dramatically improved across AST nodes, evaluators, parsers, variable operations, security functions, and API bindings. Genesis compliance maintained throughout. Ready for Week 2-3 consolidation phase.
