✅ COMPLETED TODAY:
1. JSON/YAML implementation - Pure C, no external libs needed!
   - json.stringify() and json.parse() fully working
   - yaml.stringify() and yaml.parse() basic support
   - Added to CMakeLists.txt and building successfully

2. Variable interpolation syntax change
   - Updated from  to {{var}} per boss directive
   - Modified ast_interpolate_string.c 
   - Tested and working

🔄 CURRENT WORK:
- Waiting for task assignment from Leader
- Ready to fix variable interpolation bug in assignment parsing
- Can implement loops (for/while) per blueprint

❌ UNFINISHED/BLOCKED:
- Expression parser bug: operators inside quoted strings get misparsed
- Database-like get/put operations for JSON/YAML files
- Full nested object support in YAML parser

📊 FINDINGS:
- AST evaluation works but assignment parsing has issues
- Print statements work with interpolation
- Math expressions evaluate correctly (+ - * /)

🎯 READY FOR: Any core XMD feature implementation!
