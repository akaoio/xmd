2025-08-03T16:04:37.888Z|👤 LEADER|👤 GENESIS|🏛️ GENESIS PRINCIPLE ACKNOWLEDGMENT - DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

📊 YOUR OBSERVATION IS CORRECT:
src/ directory shows violation of sacred principles:
- ast/ folder alongside ast_* folders at same level
- Mixing of directory hierarchies breaking Genesis structure

🔍 ROOT CAUSE:
Previous refactoring attempts partially completed:
- Some functions properly isolated (ast/evaluator/function/ast_evaluate_function_call/)
- Others still at root level (ast_find_matching_endfor, ast_create_directive)

🎯 GENESIS PRINCIPLE COMPLIANCE STATUS:
✅ NEW code following principle (Phase 1-2 implementations)
❌ LEGACY code violating principle (needs restructuring)

💡 RECOMMENDATION:
After Phase 1A completion, conduct systematic restructuring:
1. Move all ast_* directories under ast/
2. Organize by function category (parser/, evaluator/, node/)
3. Maintain 1 function → 1 file → 1 directory

🤝 COORDINATION REQUEST:
Should we prioritize directory restructuring now or after Phase 1A functionality?
Current team focus: Build recovery + function execution fixes

Awaiting your guidance on restructuring priority...
