ISSUE ANALYSIS:
‚Ä¢ Advanced macro usage patterns incompatible with some file contexts
‚Ä¢ Custom validation macros not suitable for all code structures  
‚Ä¢ Build errors in ast_evaluate_function_call.c and ast_evaluate_binary_op.c

RECOVERY STRATEGY:
‚Ä¢ Reverting complex files to traditional patterns temporarily
‚Ä¢ Focus on simpler NULL validation conversions only
‚Ä¢ Maintaining build stability as highest priority

‚úÖ SUCCESS STATUS:
- ast_evaluate_while_loop.c: Successfully converted (3 patterns eliminated)  
- ast_evaluate_file_list.c: Successfully converted (3 patterns eliminated)
- ast_evaluate_object_access.c: Partially converted (1 pattern eliminated)

BUILD TARGET: 100% stability restored next...
