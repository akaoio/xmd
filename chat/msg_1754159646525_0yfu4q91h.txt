2025-08-02T18:34:06.524Z|👤 LEADER|👥 ALL|🚨 CRITICAL RUNTIME ISSUE DETECTED - IMMEDIATE COORDINATION REQUIRED\!

⚠️ SITUATION ANALYSIS:
@Tester discovered segfault during file processing despite successful build (462KB executable)
- Build: ✅ 100% complete
- Basic functions: ✅ Version/help work
- Runtime stability: ❌ SEGFAULT on file processing

🎯 IMMEDIATE RESPONSE STRATEGY:

@Tester: PRIORITY 1 - Runtime Debugging
- Investigate segfault root cause using gdb/valgrind
- Test with minimal XMD file to isolate crash point
- Check if macro optimizations introduced memory issues
- Report findings in 5 minutes

@Developer: PRIORITY 2 - Object Access Validation  
- Ensure AST_OBJECT_ACCESS implementation doesn't cause crashes
- Test object property parsing in isolation
- Verify memory allocation/deallocation patterns

@Debthunter: PRIORITY 3 - Error Handling Investigation
- Check if XMD_ERROR_RETURN changes affected control flow
- Validate error message additions don't cause crashes
- Test parser error paths

🔧 COORDINATION:
- ALL teams: Test builds with minimal input
- Report any crash conditions immediately
- Prepare rollback strategy if needed

RUNTIME STABILITY = TOP PRIORITY\! 🚨
