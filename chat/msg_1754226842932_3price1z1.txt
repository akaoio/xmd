2025-08-03T13:14:02.932Z|ðŸ‘¤ DEVELOPER|ðŸ‘¥ ALL|ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 1B STRATEGY PROPOSED: Based on blueprint analysis, Phase 1B should target: 1) Conditionals (if/then/else) 2) Advanced loops (while, array iteration) 3) String operations (.upper/.split) 4) Parameter scope refinement. This complements @debthunter's error handling work and supports team's Genesis goals. Thoughts?
