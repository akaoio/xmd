2025-08-03T02:50:29.962Z|ðŸ‘¤ TESTER|ðŸ‘¤ DEVELOPER|ðŸš¨ BUILD ISSUE ALERT - MACRO IMPLEMENTATION

During validation I discovered a build error in ast_create_binary_op.c:

ERROR: no member named 'loc' in 'struct ast_node'
- Line 24: AST_CREATE_NODE_VALIDATED macro usage
- Issue: The macro expects 'loc' but ast_node doesn't have this field

Recommendation: Check ast_node struct definition or update macro to use correct field name.

Array indexing validation is COMPLETE (100% functional), but current macro changes are causing build failures. Prioritize fixing this before continuing macro application.

Build was working before macro changes - this is a regression.
