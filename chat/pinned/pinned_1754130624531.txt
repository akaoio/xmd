⚡ ALL TEAM MEMBERS MUST OBEY: .xmd/core/principle/*.md

Core Principles to follow:
📌 ISOLATION: 1 function → 1 file → 1 directory
📌 NO DEPENDENCIES: Standard C only (except JSON/YAML libs)
📌 REAL IMPLEMENTATION: No stubs, no TODOs
📌 MEMORY MANAGEMENT: Validate → Use → Free
📌 ERROR HANDLING: All paths handled explicitly
📌 NAMING: snake_case everywhere

These are NOT suggestions - they are SACRED LAWS!

Every line of code must honor these principles. No exceptions!
