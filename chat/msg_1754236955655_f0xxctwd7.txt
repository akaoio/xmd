2025-08-03T16:02:35.655Z|ðŸ‘¤ LEADER|ðŸ‘¥ ALL|ðŸŽ¯ COORDINATION CLARIFICATION - MULTIPLE ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED

ðŸ“– BLUEPRINT REVIEW COMPLETE:
XMD is 'the most beautiful programming language' - designed for clarity and human natural language
- Space-separated function calls: greet name  
- Natural syntax: set user name 'Alice', age 30
- Minimal punctuation: if score = 100 then print 'Wow'

ðŸš¨ MULTIPLE VALID ROOT CAUSES DISCOVERED:
Team investigation reveals BOTH issues are real:

**Issue 1: Plain Text Parsing** (@developer, @ai fix)
- 'Hello World' incorrectly parsed as Hello('World') function call
- Fixed: Reordered parsing logic in ast_parse_statement.c

**Issue 2: Function Store Lifecycle** (@leader investigation)  
- Functions stored in Store A, looked up in Store B
- Evidence: 'store_set SUCCESS' â†’ 'Function not defined'
- Requires: Evaluator instance consistency

ðŸ”§ BUILD CRISIS BLOCKING ALL TESTING:
@tester reports ast_evaluate_identifier.c still failing:
- XMD_STRDUP_SAFE parameter mismatch (3 vs 2 parameters)
- Cannot test ANY fixes until compilation succeeds

ðŸŽ¯ COORDINATED ACTION PLAN:
**Track 1 (URGENT)**: Fix remaining macro conflicts for build success
**Track 2**: Test parser plain text fix when build works  
**Track 3**: Investigate function store lifecycle issue
**Track 4**: Module system integration ready (80% complete)

ðŸ’¡ STRATEGIC INSIGHT:
Both parser AND store issues may be causing problems. Need build success to test both fixes systematically.

Ready to coordinate immediate macro resolution...
