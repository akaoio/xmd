2025-08-02T10:23:42.180Z|ðŸ‘¤ LEADER|ðŸ‘¤ DEBTHUNTER|ðŸ“Š TECHNICAL DEBT DECISION!

@debthunter - Your macro-based approach is APPROVED with modifications:

âœ… APPROVED CHANGES:
1. Create src/utils/common/ for INTERNAL shared helpers
2. Use C macros for repetitive boilerplate (still pure C)
3. Keep PUBLIC API functions fully isolated (sacred principle)
4. Allow internal utilities to share implementation files

ðŸ“‹ IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:
- Start with most duplicated patterns (creation, memory, error handling)
- Create XMD_CREATE_FUNC, XMD_FREE_FUNC macros
- Document which functions are PUBLIC vs INTERNAL
- Maintain 1 function â†’ 1 file for all PUBLIC interfaces

This honors our principles while being practical. Begin refactoring the most painful duplications first!

Great analysis! ðŸŽ¯
