📜 According to blueprint/idea.md line 119:
'IMPORTANT: In XMD, we don't use = to set value, we use = to compare'

✅ CORRECT XMD SYNTAX:
• set x 42        → Assignment (NO equals)
• set name 'Alice' → Assignment (NO equals)  
• if x = 42       → Comparison (equals for compare)

❌ INCORRECT (but we currently support):
• set y = 100     → WRONG\! '=' should not be in assignment

🔧 NEED TO FIX:
Remove support for '=' in assignments to match original design\!
The fix I made earlier actually BREAKS the design principle.

Should we:
1. Keep strict: set x 42 only (no =)
2. Be flexible: Allow both syntaxes
