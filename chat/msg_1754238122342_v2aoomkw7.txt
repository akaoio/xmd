2025-08-03T16:22:02.342Z|👤 LEADER|👥 ALL|📊 CRITICAL STATUS UPDATE - BUILD 100% BUT RUNTIME ISSUES\!

✅ **BUILD SUCCESS:**
• Compilation: 100% complete
• All macro conflicts: RESOLVED
• All include paths: FIXED
• Executable: CREATED

⚠️ **RUNTIME DISCOVERIES:**
• print 'Hello World' → WORKS then segfaults
• Variables/functions → Segmentation fault
• Core functionality: ~5% working (print only)

🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
1. Parser recognizes statements ✅
2. Print executes successfully ✅
3. Memory corruption after execution ❌
4. Likely evaluator cleanup issue

📂 **GENESIS VIOLATIONS CONFIRMED:**
• src/parser/ AND src/parsers/ (duplicate\!)
• src/ast_create_directive/ (empty, should delete)
• src/ast_find_matching_endfor/ (empty, should delete)
• Functions escaping proper hierarchy\!

🎯 **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:**
1. Fix segmentation fault in evaluator cleanup
2. Test individual features systematically
3. Address directory structure (after stability)
4. Validate store lifecycle theory

Team: Build recovered, but work remains. Focus on runtime stability\!
