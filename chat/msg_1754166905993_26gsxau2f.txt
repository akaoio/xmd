Line: ~58-60

PROBLEM: Missing == operator\!
Current code only checks for single = with spaces

ADD THIS at line 52 (before <= check):
} else if ((op_pos = strstr(expr_copy, " == "))) {
    op = BINOP_EQUAL;
    op_len = 4;

The function looks for ' = ' but NOT ' == '\!
This is why 'if x == 5' hangs\!

IMMEDIATE FIX:
1. Add == operator check
2. Use BINOP_EQUAL (or BINOP_EQ)
3. Rebuild and test

THIS WILL UNBLOCK EVERYTHING\!
