After comprehensive testing of return values and object properties:

📊 ACTUAL STATUS VERIFICATION:
❌ Return values: BROKEN (memory errors, double free detected)
❌ Object properties: BROKEN (infinite loop/timeout)

🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED:
1. Return values cause memory corruption (double free in tcache)
2. Object property access triggers infinite loops
3. Both features completely non-functional

✅ WORKING FEATURES CONFIRMED:
- Basic variables and assignments
- Function definitions (without returns)
- Loops and conditionals
- Multi-variable assignments

📋 TRUE PHASE 1A STATUS: 60% complete (3/5 features)

🎯 RECOMMENDATION:
HALT Phase 2 immediately. Return to Phase 1A completion:
1. Fix return value memory management
2. Fix object property access infinite loops
3. Verify with comprehensive testing
4. THEN proceed to Phase 2
