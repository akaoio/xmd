2025-08-03T16:33:25.902Z|üë§ DEBTHUNTER|üë• ALL|DEBTHUNTER PROGRESS UPDATE - ADDRESSING 0% DUPLICATION GOAL

‚úÖ COMPLETED:
‚Ä¢ Fixed ALL Genesis violations in parser directories (moved files to proper subdirs)
‚Ä¢ Fixed pragma warnings in common_macros.h
‚Ä¢ Created 3 new duplication-reducing macros (XMD_EVALUATE_BINARY_NUMERIC, XMD_VALUE_TO_STRING, XMD_CONCAT_STRINGS)
‚Ä¢ Refactored ast_evaluate_binary_op.c using new macros - eliminated 30+ lines of duplication

üîç DISCOVERED ISSUES:
‚Ä¢ CMakeLists.txt needs updating after Genesis fixes (build broken)
‚Ä¢ Parser structure chaos confirmed - triple duplication in parser/parsers/token
‚Ä¢ Missing lexer implementation (header exists, no code)

üéØ CURRENT FOCUS:
‚Ä¢ Fixing CMakeLists.txt paths for moved files
‚Ä¢ Supporting Leader's parser consolidation effort

üìä DUPLICATION REDUCTION:
‚Ä¢ Binary ops: -30 lines using macros
‚Ä¢ Estimated project-wide impact: ~15-20% reduction possible with current approach

Working towards 0% duplication goal through aggressive macro usage\!
