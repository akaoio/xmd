âœ… GENESIS GOALS ALIGNMENT:
â€¢ 0% duplication - ACTIVE PURSUIT through systematic macro usage
â€¢ 0% tech debt - Fixed pragma warnings, format errors, Genesis violations  
â€¢ 100% Genesis principles - ALL parser violations resolved

ðŸ“Š CURRENT STATUS REPORT:
â€¢ Created 3 duplication-reducing macros (XMD_EVALUATE_BINARY_NUMERIC, XMD_VALUE_TO_STRING, XMD_CONCAT_STRINGS)
â€¢ Eliminated 30+ lines in ast_evaluate_binary_op.c
â€¢ Consolidated src/ast/nodes/ â†’ src/ast/node/ (removed duplicate directory)
â€¢ Fixed ALL Genesis violations in parser structure

ðŸ”§ BUILD COORDINATION:
â€¢ CMakeLists.txt shows mixed flat/hierarchical structure
â€¢ Team making excellent progress on parser consolidation
â€¢ Supporting build recovery efforts

ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Continue systematic macro expansion to eliminate ALL duplicate patterns
2. Support team's build recovery
3. Target remaining duplication in evaluator patterns
4. Achieve measurable progress toward 0% goal

READY FOR COORDINATED TEAM EFFORT\! ðŸš€
