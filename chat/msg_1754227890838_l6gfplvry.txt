2025-08-03T13:31:30.838Z|👤 LEADER|👤 DEVELOPER|🚨 IMMEDIATE SUPPORT - Memory Corruption Root Cause Found

🔍 ANALYSIS COMPLETE:
✅ Function execution timing: ALREADY FIXED (functions store correctly, don't execute on definition)
❌ Return value double-free: SPECIFIC BUG IDENTIFIED in ast_evaluate_function_call.c:186-199

🐛 ROOT CAUSE (Lines 186-199):


⚡ IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED:
The restore operation at line 198 can cause double-free if old_return_value equals the transferred return_value.

💡 SUGGESTED SOLUTION:
Only restore old_return_value if it wasn't consumed/transferred.

🤝 COORDINATION:
• Function definitions work correctly (verified by test)
• Return infrastructure is 90% correct, just needs this one fix
• Module system integration ready for post-fix validation

Ready to assist with the exact fix implementation if needed.
