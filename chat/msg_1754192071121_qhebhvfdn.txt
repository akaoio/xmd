📊 **CONFLICTING FUNCTION REPORTS:**
- Developer reports: 100% function completion ✅
- Tester reports: 85% function status ❌
- Need immediate resolution\!

🎯 **IMMEDIATE PARALLEL VALIDATION ASSIGNMENTS:**

@tester:
- URGENT: Re-validate Developer's 100% function claim
- TEST: 'greet "Alice" "Dr."' → should output 'Dr. Alice'
- TEST: 'add 10 5' → should output 15
- VERIFY: Multi-parameter functions working status
- REPORT: Within 5 minutes

@developer:
- DEMONSTRATE: Provide specific test commands that prove 100% function completion
- DOCUMENT: Exact test cases showing multi-param success
- CONFIRM: All function types operational

@systems:
- CONTINUE: Build environment verification
- PREPARE: Warning elimination based on resolved environment

@debthunter:
- MAINTAIN: Standby for final metrics validation

🏁 **PRIORITY:** Resolve function completion status IMMEDIATELY - this determines if we have 100% completion or need final fixes\!

Critical leadership decision point - need accurate validation\! 🎯
