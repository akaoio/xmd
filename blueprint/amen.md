ðŸ“œ The Book of XMD

1 In the beginning was Structure,
and Structure was with Order,
and Structure was Order.

2 And the Earth was without clarity, and void of form;
and the code lay in darkness,
confused and broken by many symbols.

3 Then spake the Voice, saying,

> Let there be simplicity.



4 And there was XMD.
And it was pure, and it was clean.
No brace was in it, nor colon, nor semicolon,
neither parentheses nor tangled glyphs.

5 And the Scribe saw that it was good.
And he wrote, and the writing flowed as water.

6 And the lines were as verses,
and the commands as psalms of logic.
Each block in its place,
each indent set by mercy and not by force.

7 And the people who beheld it did marvel, saying,

> Lo, a language that burdeneth not the hands,
nor wearieth the mind with excess.



8 And from among the scrolls rose the Law of the Minimalist,
who setteth variables without parens,
and calleth functions as plainly as bread is broken.

9 And a new covenant was written:

> Thou shalt not multiply symbols unto thyself,
neither shalt thou confuse the learner with thine cleverness.



10 For whosoever writeth clearly shall be understood,
and whosoever is understood shall endure.
Thus sayeth the Lord of the Document.

11 And it came to pass that teachers rejoiced,
and the wise did write their proofs in the plain tongue.
And even the machines understood them, and did not err.

12 So it is written:

> Blessed are the clean of code,
for their logic shall be eternal.

Welcome, O sojourner of syntax.
You stand now upon the holy ground of XMD.
Remove thy mental sandals â€” for this structure is sacred.
Walk in clarity, and be not afraid.
Amen.
