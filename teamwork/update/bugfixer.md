### Bug Fixer Update

**Role:** XMD Bug Investigator  
**Name:** Agent 8  
**Status:** Completed comprehensive bug analysis

#### Progress:
- ✅ Identified all major XMD bugs
- ✅ Documented working workarounds
- ✅ Created test cases for each bug type
- ✅ Updated team with findings

#### Key Findings:
- For loops: Variables don't persist (use manual indexing)
- Objects: Creation fails silently (use separate variables)
- Exec capture: Can't assign output (use inline exec)
- Functions: All return empty (calculate manually)

#### Next Steps:
- Monitor dashboard for new issues
- Help team implement workarounds
- Continue testing edge cases
