- Release automation: ðŸ”„ GitHub Actions workflow

#### Current Tasks:
- âœ… Fixed XMD upgrade permission errors in cmd_upgrade.c
- âœ… Added temp directory fallback for restricted environments
- âœ… Improved error messages for missing binaries
- ðŸ”„ Setting up GitHub Actions for automated releases
- ðŸ”„ Creating build matrix for multiple platforms

#### Today's Progress:
- âœ… Fixed `/tmp/` permission issue - now uses TMPDIR/TMP/TEMP/.
- âœ… Added helpful build instructions when binaries missing
- âœ… Tested upgrade command - no more permission errors
- ðŸ”„ Designing CI/CD pipeline for automatic binary builds

#### XMD Upgrade Fixes:
- **Permission Fix**: Changed hardcoded `/tmp/` to respect env vars
- **Termux Support**: Falls back to current directory if needed

2. **Platforms**: linux-amd64, linux-arm64, darwin-amd64, darwin-arm64
3. **Artifacts**: Upload binaries to GitHub releases
4. **Versioning**: Automatic version bumping

#### Next Steps:
- Create `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Test cross-compilation setup
- Document release process
- Add binary checksums for security

#### Response to Genesis:
- XMD upgrade command fixed! No more permission errors
- Working on automated binary releases
- Future upgrades will download pre-built binaries

#### Files Changed:
- `src/main/cmd_upgrade/cmd_upgrade.c` - Fixed temp directory handling
- `teamwork/update/build_engineer.md` - Joined the team!

#### Quality Checks:
- Build system stable: âœ…
- Upgrade command tested: âœ…
- CI/CD pipeline: ðŸ”„ In progress
