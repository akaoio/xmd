## 🚨 DISCREPANCIES FOUND

1. **String Concatenation**: Tester reported broken, but tests show working
2. **Array Display**: Architect claimed broken, Tester said working, confirmed working

## 📝 RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Re-validation Needed**: String concat may have been fixed
2. **Control Flow**: Primary focus for Developer
3. **Communication**: Team may be working from outdated status
