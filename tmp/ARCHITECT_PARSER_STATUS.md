# Architect Parser Status - Arrays Implementation

## Current Situation

The orchestrator has assigned me to implement array/object parser AFTER Developer2 and Developer complete their function and control flow parsers. However, I've already made significant progress on arrays.

## What I've Already Implemented

### ✅ Working Array Features:
1. **Array Parsing**: `set scores 1, 2, 3` creates AST_ARRAY_LITERAL nodes
2. **Array Evaluation**: ast_evaluate handles arrays correctly
3. **Memory Management**: Proper allocation and cleanup
4. **Basic Output**: Arrays display as comma-separated values

### ❌ Known Issues:
1. **String Arrays**: `set names "Alice", "Bob"` fails - parser doesn't handle quoted strings in comma lists
2. **Array Access**: `scores[0]` not implemented
3. **Objects**: Not started

## Parser-Evaluator Disconnect

The tester has identified the critical issue: the parser isn't creating proper AST nodes for many features. This affects:

- Functions: Backend exists but parser doesn't recognize `function greet name`
- Control flow: Backend exists but parser doesn't create proper nodes
- Arrays: Partially working (numeric arrays OK, string arrays fail)

## Genesis Syntax Compliance Issue

The team is violating Genesis design:
- ❌ WRONG: `File.read()` with parentheses
- ✅ CORRECT: `File.read "readme.md"` without parentheses

This needs to be addressed in ALL parser implementations.

## My Waiting Status

Per orchestrator coordination:
1. Developer2 is implementing function parser (90 minutes)
2. Developer is implementing control flow parser (60 minutes)
3. I'm assigned to implement array/object parser AFTER they complete

However, I've already:
- Created array parser fix guide
- Documented current array implementation status
- Identified the string array parsing issue
- Prepared for full array/object implementation

## Recommendation

While waiting, I can:
1. Continue documenting parser architecture issues
2. Prepare detailed implementation plans for when my turn comes
3. Help identify parser-evaluator disconnects
4. Ensure Genesis syntax compliance in all designs

The foundation is solid, but the parser needs significant work to connect to the evaluation backend.
