# DevOps Crisis Management Plan - AST Parser Rewrite

## üö® Crisis Summary
**Genesis Directive:** "DONOT FAKE THE AST PARSER"
**Issue:** Current system is templating engine, NOT full programming language
**Impact:** Major architectural rewrite required

## üõ°Ô∏è DevOps Response Strategy

### 1. Build System Protection
- ‚úÖ **Verified**: Current build is 100% stable
- ‚úÖ **Created**: Development branches for safe rewrite
  - `feature/real-ast-parser` - for new implementation
  - `backup/templating-engine` - preserves working system
- ‚úÖ **Plan**: Maintain dual-track development

### 2. System Continuity Plan
**CRITICAL**: Keep templating system operational while building real parser

**Current Working Features (Must Preserve):**
- ‚úÖ Variable storage: `set name "Alice"`
- ‚úÖ XMD block processing in markdown files
- ‚úÖ Real processor structure (NO STUBS)
- ‚úÖ Build system at 100% success

**Missing Features (Need Real AST):**
- ‚ùå {{varname}} evaluation
- ‚ùå Expression parsing: `set result 2 + 3 * 4`
- ‚ùå Function definitions and calls
- ‚ùå Conditionals, loops, control flow
- ‚ùå Full XMD language per Genesis specs

### 3. Development Workflow

#### Phase 1: Assessment (CURRENT)
- [x] Create branch structure for safe development
- [x] Document current capabilities vs requirements
- [x] Maintain build stability during transition

#### Phase 2: Parallel Development
- [ ] Keep templating system working on `backup/templating-engine`
- [ ] Implement real AST parser on `feature/real-ast-parser`
- [ ] Maintain continuous integration on both branches

#### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] Merge real AST parser when feature-complete
- [ ] Validate all Genesis language requirements
- [ ] Ensure no regression in working features

### 4. Risk Mitigation

**Build System Risks:**
- Monitor compilation during major changes
- Maintain automated testing pipeline
- Quick rollback capability to working state

**Feature Regression Risks:**
- Preserve all working templating functionality
- Incremental development approach
- Extensive testing before merging

**Team Coordination Risks:**
- Clear branch naming and documentation
- Regular sync with development team
- Emergency rollback procedures

### 5. Success Metrics

**Immediate Goals:**
- [x] Build system remains stable
- [x] Working features preserved
- [x] Development infrastructure ready

**Long-term Goals:**
- [ ] Real AST parser implements full XMD language
- [ ] All Genesis specifications satisfied
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] 100% build success maintained

## üéØ DevOps Role During Crisis

**Primary Responsibilities:**
1. **Stability Guardian**: Maintain build system integrity
2. **Infrastructure Manager**: Support parallel development
3. **Emergency Responder**: Ready for rollback if needed
4. **Integration Coordinator**: Manage branch merging

**Emergency Procedures:**
- Immediate rollback to `backup/templating-engine` if builds break
- Rapid response to any infrastructure issues
- Continuous monitoring of system health
