# Basic XMD Feature Tests
# Based on XMD Language Specification from blueprint/idea.md
# Testing core features to identify implementation gaps

# 1. Variables (Basic)
set name "Alice"
set age 30  
set active true
set empty null

print "Name: " + name
print "Age: " + age
print "Active: " + active
print "Empty: " + empty

# 2. Arrays (Inline - Preferred)
set scores 85, 90, 78
print "Scores: " + scores[0] + ", " + scores[1] + ", " + scores[2]

# 7. For loops (Basic range)
for i in 1 .. 3
    print "For loop: " + i

# 8. String Operations
set text "Hello World"
set upper text.upper
print "Uppercase: " + upper

# 9. Math Operations
set a 10
set b 5

print "Multiply: " + (a * b)
print "Divide: " + (a / b)

# 10. Boolean Operations
set x true
