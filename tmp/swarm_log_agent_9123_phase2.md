# Swarm Agent 9123 - Phase 2 Log

## Timestamp: 2025-08-04

## Features Implemented

### 1. Loop N Times Syntax Support (COMPLETED)
- Enhanced `/home/x/Projects/xmd/src/ast/parser/loop/ast_parse_loop_times/ast_parse_loop_times.c`
- Added support for variable expressions, not just numeric literals
- Integrated into statement parser at `/home/x/Projects/xmd/src/ast/parser/statement/ast_parse_statement/ast_parse_statement.c`
- Now supports:
  - `loop 5 times` (numeric literal)
  - `loop count times` (variable reference)

### 2. Ternary Operator Integration (COMPLETED)
- Integrated ternary parser into expression parser
- Modified `/home/x/Projects/xmd/src/ast/parser/expression/ast_parse_expression/ast_parse_expression.c`
- Added support for `condition ? true_expr : false_expr` syntax
- Parser already existed but wasn't being called

## Test Files Created
- `/home/x/Projects/xmd/tmp/test_loop_times.xmd` - Loop N times tests
- `/home/x/Projects/xmd/tmp/test_ternary.xmd` - Ternary operator tests

## Next Steps for Swarm
Priority features still missing from XMD spec:
1. Lambda/arrow functions (x => x * 2)
2. Class definitions with constructors and methods
3. Try/catch error handling
4. Async/await
5. Generators (function*)
6. Destructuring
7. Template literals with {{variable}} interpolation
8. Import/export statements
9. File I/O operations (File.read, File.write)
10. Date/time operations

## Build Status
- Fixed previous build errors
- Code compiles successfully
- Following swarm principles: one function per file

## Compliance
✅ Genesis principle compliance
✅ Test-driven development 
✅ Clean folder structure maintained
✅ Using tmp/ for temporary files
✅ Coordinating through logs
