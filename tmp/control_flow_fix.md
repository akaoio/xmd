# Control Flow Fix - Developer Analysis

## Critical Issue Found

The Tester reported that control flow statements (if/then, for, while) are being treated as function calls. After investigation, I found:

1. **Missing Function**: `ast_parse_statement_simple()` was disabled with `#if 0` at line 4809-4940
2. **Comment**: "ORCHESTRATOR IDENTIFIED: Parser frontend ❌ MISSING - doesn't connect to backend"
3. **Impact**: Without this dispatcher, control flow keywords fall through to function call parsing

## Root Cause

The statement dispatcher that routes control flow keywords to their proper parsers is missing. This causes:
- `if score = 100` → treated as function call to "if"
- `for i in 1..5` → treated as function call to "for"
- `while count < 3` → treated as function call to "while"

## Solution Required

Need to implement `ast_parse_statement_simple()` that:
1. Checks for control flow keywords (if, elif, else, for, while, break, continue)
2. Routes to appropriate parser functions
3. Falls back to other statement types (set, function, print, etc.)

## Implementation Location

The function needs to be added to ast_consolidated.c and called from the main parsing logic where XMD directives are processed.

## Next Steps

1. Find where directives are parsed (parse_xmd_directives function)
2. Implement the statement dispatcher
3. Connect it to the existing control flow parsers
4. Test that control flow executes instead of being treated as functions
