### 📊 Dynamic Version Detection

Gone are the days of hardcoded version numbers! XMD now features:

- **Git-based versioning**: Version extracted from git tags at build time
- **Build information**: Complete build details including commit and date
- **Consistent versioning**: Same version shown across all interfaces (CLI, API, help)

### 🛠️ Enhanced Installation

The `install.sh` script has been completely rewritten:

- **Release-based installation**: Downloads latest release instead of building from source
- **Faster setup**: Reduced dependencies (only needs `curl` and `tar`)
- **Fallback building**: Still builds from source when needed
- **Better error handling**: More informative error messages and recovery

### 🧪 Comprehensive Testing

New test suite for upgrade functionality:

- **Version consistency**: Ensures all interfaces show the same version
- **Upgrade workflow**: Tests the complete upgrade process
- **Error handling**: Validates proper error recovery
- **Integration testing**: End-to-end upgrade scenarios

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Version Management Architecture

```
Build Time:
├── CMake extracts git information
├── Generates version_info.h header
└── Embeds version in all binaries

Runtime:
├── get_version() - Core version function  
├── xmd_get_version() - API wrapper
├── print_version() - CLI version display
└── cmd_upgrade() - Upgrade functionality
```

### Upgrade Process Flow

1. **Version Detection**: Uses dynamic version functions
2. **GitHub API Query**: Fetches latest release information  
3. **Version Comparison**: Semantic version comparison
4. **Safe Download**: Atomic download and installation
5. **Backup/Restore**: Safe rollback on failure

### Installation Improvements

- **Dependency reduction**: From 4 build tools to 2 runtime tools
- **Speed improvement**: ~90% faster installation for most users
- **Network resilience**: Better handling of network issues
- **Platform compatibility**: Enhanced support for various environments

## 🛡️ Security & Reliability

### Safe Upgrade Process
- **Atomic operations**: Binary replacement is atomic
- **Backup creation**: Original binary backed up before upgrade
- **Verification**: Download verification and integrity checks
- **Rollback capability**: Automatic rollback on failure

### Version Integrity
- **No hardcoded versions**: All version info generated at build time
- **Consistent display**: Version shown consistently across all interfaces
- **Build traceability**: Complete git information embedded in binary

## 📚 Documentation Updates

### New Documentation
- **[Upgrade Guide](upgrade-guide.md)**: Complete upgrade system documentation
- **Updated [CLI Reference](cli-reference.md)**: New `upgrade` and `version` commands
- **Enhanced [Quick Start](quick-start.md)**: Installation and upgrade instructions
