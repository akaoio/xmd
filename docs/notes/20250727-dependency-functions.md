# Dependency Functions Implementation

**Author**: XMD Implementation Team

## Overview
Need to implement missing dependency functions called by detector.c:
- `reset_visit_states(detector->graph)` - Reset visit states for all nodes
- `clear_cycle_path(detector)` - Clear the cycle path tracking
- `dfs_cycle_detection(detector, node)` - DFS-based cycle detection

## Implementation Plan
Following INSTRUCTIONS.md Rule 2&3 (one function per file with snake_case naming):

1. `src/dependency/detector/reset_visit_states/reset_visit_states.c`
2. `src/dependency/detector/clear_cycle_path/clear_cycle_path.c` 
3. `src/dependency/detector/dfs_cycle_detection/dfs_cycle_detection.c`

## Requirements
- Follow existing dependency detection patterns
- Use DFS algorithm for cycle detection
- Track visit states: 0=white (unvisited), 1=gray (visiting), 2=black (visited)
- Store cycle path for debugging
