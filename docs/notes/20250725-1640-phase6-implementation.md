# Phase 6 Security & Performance Implementation

## Overview
Implementing Phase 6 of XMD: Security hardening, performance optimization, caching, and threading for production readiness.

## Architecture Components

### 6.1 Security Hardening (src/security/)
- **validator/validator.c**: Input validation against injection attacks
- **sanitizer/sanitizer.c**: Output sanitization for safe rendering  
- **auditor/auditor.c**: Security audit logging and monitoring

### 6.2 Performance (src/performance/)
- **optimizer/optimizer.c**: AST optimization passes
- **profiler/profiler.c**: Runtime performance profiling
- **benchmark/benchmark.c**: Comprehensive benchmark suite

### 6.3 Caching (src/cache/)
- **memory_cache/memory_cache.c**: Fast in-memory LRU cache
- **disk_cache/disk_cache.c**: Persistent file-based cache
- **invalidator/invalidator.c**: Smart cache invalidation

### 6.4 Threading (src/threading/)
- **pool/pool.c**: Thread pool for concurrent execution
- **scheduler/scheduler.c**: Task scheduling and prioritization
- **synchronizer/synchronizer.c**: Lock-free synchronization

## Implementation Strategy

### Security First
1. Input validation for all entry points
2. Command injection prevention
3. Path traversal protection
4. Resource exhaustion limits

### Performance Targets
- <10ms per MB parsing
- <50MB memory for 1GB file
- 100+ concurrent operations
- 90% cache hit rate

### Implementation Order
1. Security validator/sanitizer (critical)
2. Memory cache (high impact)
3. Performance profiler (measurement)
4. Thread pool (concurrency)
5. AST optimizer (algorithmic gains)
6. Disk cache (persistence)

## Testing Strategy
- Security: fuzzing, injection tests
- Performance: benchmarks, profiling
- Caching: hit/miss ratios, consistency
- Threading: race condition detection

## Files Created
Following one-file-per-function rule with comprehensive tests first.
