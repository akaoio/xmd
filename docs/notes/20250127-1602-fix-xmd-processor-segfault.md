# Fix XMD Processor Segmentation Fault

**Date:** 2025-01-27 16:02  
**Author:** Claude  
**Status:** Memory Management Issue Analysis and Fix

## Current Situation

24/25 tests passing (96% success rate). Only remaining failure: `xmd_processor_tests` (SEGFAULT)

## Root Cause Analysis (Rule 14 - Memory management)

**Issue:** Segmentation fault in `execute_command` function during `fread` operation
**Location:** `/src/xmd_processor/execute_command/execute_command.c:27`
**Stack trace:** 
```
execute_command -> process_exec -> process_directive -> process_xmd_content -> test_command_execution
```

**Memory corruption:** `buf=0xffffffffdcf0` suggests invalid buffer address passed to `fread`

## Implementation Plan (Rules 7, 13, 14)

### Phase 1: Buffer Validation (Rule 13)
1. Add null pointer checks to `execute_command` parameters
2. Validate buffer size before `fread` operations
3. Add bounds checking for output buffer

### Phase 2: Memory Management (Rule 14)
1. Check buffer allocation in calling chain: `process_xmd_content` -> `process_directive` -> `process_exec`
2. Ensure proper buffer initialization and cleanup
3. Fix any memory leaks or double-free issues

### Phase 3: Real Implementation (Rule 7)
1. Replace any mock implementations with real code
2. Ensure all error paths are properly handled
3. Test with minimal working implementation

## Expected Outcome

All 25 tests passing (100% success rate) with full INSTRUCTIONS.md compliance.

## Implementation Strategy

Start with minimal buffer validation, then trace the memory allocation chain to find the root cause.
