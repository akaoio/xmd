# Join Function Implementation

## Purpose
Implement a `join` function for XMD that takes an array and returns a comma-separated string.

## Current Issue
- User wants to use `join ["debug","for now","in real","in a real","mock"]`
- This function doesn't exist in XMD system
- Currently results in empty output

## Requirements
- Function name: `join`
- Input: Array of strings
- Output: Comma-separated string (e.g., "debug, for now, in real, in a real, mock")
- Follow XMD function calling conventions

## Implementation Plan
1. Create test first (test-driven development)
2. Add join function to AST function evaluation system
3. Handle array input and string output
4. Use existing XMD function patterns

## Technical Notes
- Must integrate with existing AST function call system
- Follow file/folder naming: `ast_evaluate_function_join/ast_evaluate_function_join.c`
- Handle memory management properly
- Return meaningful error codes
- Support both array literals and array variables

## Success Criteria
- `join ["a","b","c"]` returns "a, b, c"
- `set arr = ["x","y"]; join arr` works
- Memory is properly managed
- Error handling for invalid inputs
