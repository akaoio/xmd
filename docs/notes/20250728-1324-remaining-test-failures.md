# Remaining Test Failures Analysis

## Status After Memory Corruption Fixes
- Previous fixes resolved critical buffer overflows and realloc failures
- Test pass rate: 29/38 (76%) - same as before but crashes converted to logic errors
- 9 remaining failures: 3 segfaults, 1 memory corruption, 5 assertion failures

## Critical Segfault Issues
### Pattern Analysis
All 3 segfaulting tests show identical behavior:
- Empty output in test logs
- Immediate crash with no diagnostic information  
- Segfault occurs during test initialization, not processing

### Affected Tests
1. **upgrade_version_tests** - Version management functionality
2. **cli_e2e_tests** - End-to-end CLI testing
3. **sandbox_tests** - Sandboxed execution testing

### Likely Root Causes
- Null pointer dereference in test setup
- Missing initialization of global state
- Platform-specific library issues
- Invalid function pointers or uninitialized structs

## Memory Corruption (Still Active)
### real_performance_tests
- Error: "malloc(): corrupted top size" on 100KB file processing
- Location: During XMD processing of generated large content
- Issue: Not in test generation (fixed) but in core XMD processing pipeline
- Affects: Large file processing capability

## Assertion Failures (Logic Issues)
### String Processing Issues
- **advanced_scripting_tests**: String concatenation not producing expected "Hello World"
- **variable_advanced_tests**: Null string conversion not producing empty string
- **multiline_enhanced_tests**: Output accumulation missing expected "Line 1"

### Output Generation Issues  
- **truncate_fix_tests**: Command output not generating expected line count (>100)
- **advanced_integration_tests**: Documentation generation missing expected format

## Next Steps
Priority order based on impact:
1. Segfault fixes (blocks test execution)
2. Memory corruption fix (blocks large file processing)
3. Logic fixes (feature correctness)

## Technical Approach
- Use gdb for segfault analysis
- Valgrind for memory corruption tracking
- Unit test isolation for logic issues
