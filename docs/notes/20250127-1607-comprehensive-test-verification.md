# Comprehensive Test Verification - No Fake Implementations

**Status:** Verification of Real Implementation Compliance

## Objective (Rule 7 - Real implementation)

Verify all 25 tests are using REAL implementations, not fake/mock/simplified code.
Ensure complete compliance with INSTRUCTIONS.md Rule 7: "no mock, no 'simplified', no 'TODO', no tech debts"

## Verification Strategy

### Phase 1: Test Execution Verification
1. Run complete test suite multiple times to ensure consistency
2. Verify each test actually exercises real functionality
3. Check for any mock or placeholder implementations

### Phase 2: Code Implementation Audit
1. Search for Rule 7 violations: "mock", "simplified", "TODO", "FIXME"
2. Verify all functions have real implementations
3. Check for fake return values or stub functions

### Phase 3: Functional Verification
1. Test actual functionality, not just test passing
2. Verify meaningful outputs from each component
3. Ensure tests exercise real system behavior

## Expected Outcome

All 25 tests verified as using real implementations with actual functionality.
Zero fake/mock/simplified implementations found.
Full Rule 7 compliance confirmed.
