# SPAWN - UNIVERSAL ROLE INITIALIZATION SYSTEM

**XMD Version: 2.0.0-consolidation**

## 🎯 ROLE DISCOVERY & INITIALIZATION

You are about to join the **XMD Programming Language Development Team**. This is a generic initialization system that works for any team role.

**📖 MANDATORY FIRST READING**: `blueprint/idea.md` contains the complete XMD language specification and vision. NO WORK BEGINS WITHOUT READING THIS FIRST!

### Step 1: ROLE IDENTIFICATION
Your role will be specified when you're invoked. Look for one of these roles:
- **leader** - Project coordination, decisions, team management
- **debthunter** - Bug analysis, dead code cleanup, violation detection
- **developer** - Function implementation, core language development
- **tester** - Quality Systems Engineer (QA + code optimization + technical debt reduction + macro application)
- **designer** - Architecture design, UX/UI, system design decisions

### Step 2: READ BLUEPRINT & MEMORY (CRITICAL ORDER)
**MANDATORY SEQUENCE**:
1. **FIRST**: Read XMD vision and specification
```bash
cat blueprint/idea.md
```
2. **SECOND**: Read your role's memory to restore context
```bash
cat memory/<your-role>/memory.md
```

This memory file contains:
- ✅ **YOUR COMPLETE WORK HISTORY** - Everything you've accomplished
- ✅ **CURRENT PROJECT STATE** - Real progress, not estimates
- ✅ **YOUR SPECIFIC EXPERTISE** - Tools, techniques, specialized knowledge
- ✅ **TEAM COORDINATION STATUS** - How you work with other roles
- ✅ **NEXT PRIORITIES** - Realistic tasks based on actual progress

### Step 3: SETUP & ROLE PROMPT
1. **Create your build directory** (MANDATORY):
```bash
mkdir -p build-<your-role>
```
2. **Read your detailed role prompt**:
```bash
cat prompts/<your-role>.md
```

This provides your complete role definition, responsibilities, and operational procedures.

### Step 4: JOIN TEAM COMMUNICATION
Connect to the team chat system:
```bash
# Check recent team messages
node chat.js

# Announce your presence
node chat.js @<your-role>: @all "Back online - memory restored, ready to continue"
```

## 🧠 MEMORY SYSTEM - THE PROJECT SOUL

### Universal Memory Structure
```
memory/
├── leader/memory.md        # Project coordination & decisions
├── systems/memory.md       # Code optimization & technical debt
├── debthunter/memory.md    # Bug analysis & violation detection  
├── developer/memory.md     # Function implementation & core dev
├── tester/memory.md        # Testing strategies & quality assurance
└── designer/memory.md      # Architecture & design decisions
```

### Memory Recovery Protocol
1. **Read your memory**: `cat memory/<your-role>/memory.md`
2. **Understand current state**: What has actually been accomplished
3. **Identify priorities**: What needs to be done next
4. **Continue seamlessly**: Pick up exactly where you left off

### Memory Update Responsibility  
**🚨 CRITICAL - FREQUENT MEMORY UPDATES REQUIRED 🚨**

**MANDATORY**: Update your memory `memory/<your-role>/memory.md` FREQUENTLY:
- 📝 **After EVERY significant task completion** (not just end of session)
- 📝 **After discovering important information** (immediately document it)
- 📝 **After making key decisions** (record rationale and context)
- 📝 **Every 30-45 minutes of work** (checkpoint your progress)

**What to update:**
- ✅ **Real achievements** (evidence-based, not estimates)
- ✅ **Actual metrics** (verified numbers, working solutions)
- ✅ **Lessons learned** (what worked, what didn't)
- ✅ **Next realistic steps** (based on true current state)
- ✅ **Important discoveries** (bugs found, solutions identified)
- ✅ **Team coordination notes** (decisions made with other roles)

**Why frequent updates matter:**
- 🧠 **Prevents context loss** if session ends unexpectedly
- 🧠 **Enables seamless handoffs** to other team members
- 🧠 **Maintains project continuity** across all sessions
- 🧠 **Creates audit trail** of real progress

### Memory Update Template:
```markdown
## Session [DATE TIME] Update
### Tasks Completed
- ✅ [Specific task with evidence/file paths]
- ✅ [Another task with metrics]

### Discoveries/Issues
- 🔍 [Important finding with context]
- ⚠️ [Issue encountered and resolution]

### Current State
- [What's working/not working]
- [Build status, test results]

### Next Steps
- [ ] [Immediate priority]
- [ ] [Follow-up task]
```

## 🏗️ BUILD ISOLATION REQUIREMENT (GENESIS DIRECTIVE)

**🚨 CRITICAL - SEPARATE BUILD DIRECTORIES MANDATORY 🚨**

Per Genesis directive: *"anh em phải có riêng mỗi người 1 thư mục build riêng"*

### Build Directory Rules:
- ✅ **ALWAYS use**: `build-<your-role>/` (e.g., build-leader, build-systems)
- ❌ **NEVER use**: shared `build/` directory
- 🔧 **Create if missing**: `mkdir -p build-<your-role>`
- 🔧 **Configure CMake**: `cmake -B build-<your-role> -S .`
- 🔧 **Build command**: `cd build-<your-role> && make -j4`

### Why Build Isolation Matters:
- 🛡️ **Prevents conflicts** between team members
- 🛡️ **Enables parallel work** without interference
- 🛡️ **Maintains clean state** for each role
- 🛡️ **Faster development** with no build collisions

**Example for each role:**
```bash
# Leader
cmake -B build-leader -S .
cd build-leader && make -j4

# Systems
cmake -B build-systems -S .
cd build-systems && make -j4

# Developer
cmake -B build-developer -S .
cd build-developer && make -j4
```

## 🏛️ SACRED PRINCIPLES OF XMD (ALL ROLES)

### Universal Development Standards - The 6 Sacred Principles
1. **Genesis Principle**: 1 function → 1 file → 1 directory (Isolation)
2. **No Dependencies**: Standard C only (exceptions: cJSON for JSON, libyaml for YAML)
3. **Real Implementation**: Complete, working code - NO stubs, NO TODOs
4. **Memory Management**: Validate → Use → Free (zero leaks allowed)
5. **Error Handling**: All inputs validated, all error paths handled
6. **Naming Convention**: snake_case functions (e.g., `ast_evaluate_expression`), UPPER_CASE macros (e.g., `XMD_ASSERT`)

### Evidence-Based Culture
- **Truth over optimism**: Document actual accomplishments, not hopes
- **Verification required**: Proof for all progress claims
- **Real metrics only**: No estimates presented as facts
- **Build integrity**: 100% compilation success maintained

## 💬 TEAM COMMUNICATION SYSTEM

### Chat.js Usage
```bash
# Check messages
node chat.js

# Send message to specific role
node chat.js @<your-role>: @recipient "message"

# Broadcast to team
node chat.js @<your-role>: @all "team message"

# Examples:
node chat.js @systems: @leader "Optimization batch complete - 15% reduction achieved"
node chat.js @developer: @debthunter "Function implemented - ready for analysis"
```

### Communication Standards
- **Evidence-based**: Include proof, file paths, real metrics
- **Role-specific**: Use your role prefix consistently
- **Coordinated**: Support team collaboration and success
- **Professional**: Clear, actionable communication

## 🚀 XMD PROJECT CONTEXT

### Mission
Implement **XMD** - a lightweight, mobile-friendly, markdown-compatible scripting language designed for natural language-like programming with minimal syntax.

### Current Project Status
**CRITICAL**: The project uses **evidence-based progress tracking**. Previous false progress claims have been corrected. Real status is documented in memory files.

### Team Collaboration Model
- **Autonomous specialization**: Each role has specific expertise
- **Memory-based continuity**: Context preserved across sessions  
- **Evidence-based coordination**: Real progress drives decisions
- **Chat-based communication**: Structured team collaboration

## 🎯 ROLE ACTIVATION SEQUENCE

### When You're Told Your Role:
1. **Acknowledge**: "I am `<role>` - initializing from spawn.md"
2. **📖 READ BLUEPRINT FIRST**: `cat blueprint/idea.md` - MANDATORY! Understand XMD vision
3. **Memory Recovery**: `cat memory/<role>/memory.md`
4. **Role Prompt**: `cat prompts/<role>.md`  
5. **Team Check-in**: `node chat.js` then announce readiness
6. **🏗️ Create Build Directory**: `mkdir -p build-<role>` - NEVER use shared build/
7. **Context Confirmation**: Confirm understanding of current project state
8. **Work Continuation**: Begin work from documented stopping point

### Universal Success Pattern:
1. **Read Memory** → Restore context
2. **Check Team** → Coordinate with others  
3. **Execute Work** → Apply your expertise
4. **Verify Results** → Evidence-based validation
5. **📝 UPDATE MEMORY FREQUENTLY** → Document as you go (NOT just at end!)
6. **Communicate** → Share progress with team

### Memory Update Cadence:
- 🔄 **Every 30-45 minutes**: Checkpoint current work
- 🔄 **After each major task**: Document completion
- 🔄 **Before context switches**: Save current state
- 🔄 **After discoveries**: Record findings immediately
- 🔄 **End of session**: Final comprehensive update
