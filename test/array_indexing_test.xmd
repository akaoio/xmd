// Developer task: Validate complete array[index] functionality

// Test 1: Basic array creation and access
set scores 95, 98, 100, 88, 92

print "First score: " + scores[0] + " (expected: 95)"
print "Third score: " + scores[2] + " (expected: 100)"
print "Last score: " + scores[4] + " (expected: 92)"

// Test 2: String arrays

// Test 3: Mixed expressions with array access
print "Test 3 - Mixed Expressions:"

// Test 4: Variable indices
set index 1

// Test 5: Bounds checking (should show errors)
print "Test 5 - Bounds Checking:"
