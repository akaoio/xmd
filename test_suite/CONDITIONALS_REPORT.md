# Conditionals Testing Report
**Date**: 2025-08-03 03:27  
**Tester**: Quality Systems Engineer  
**Priority**: HIGH (Leader directive)

## Executive Summary
Conditionals (if/else) are **NOT WORKING** - tests hang indefinitely when any conditional statement is encountered.

## Test Results

### ✅ WORKING (Baseline Features)
- Variables: Set and retrieve correctly
- Print: Basic output works
- String concatenation: Works in print statements
- Basic arithmetic: Addition for concatenation

### ❌ NOT WORKING (Conditionals)

#### Test Case 1: Simple If Statement
```xmd
set x 10
if x > 5
    print "X is greater than 5"
```
**Result**: HANGS - Program enters infinite loop or deadlock

#### Test Case 2: All Comparison Operators
Cannot test operators in conditionals due to hanging issue:
- `==` (equality) - UNTESTABLE
- `!=` (inequality) - UNTESTABLE  
- `<` (less than) - UNTESTABLE
- `>` (greater than) - UNTESTABLE
- `<=` (less than or equal) - UNTESTABLE
- `>=` (greater than or equal) - UNTESTABLE

## Root Cause Analysis

### Likely Issues:
1. **Parser Issue**: Conditional parsing may create infinite loop
2. **Evaluator Issue**: ast_evaluate_conditional may have logic error
3. **Comparison Operation**: Binary operators for comparison not implemented

### Evidence:
- Program hangs immediately upon encountering `if` statement
- No debug output after conditional parse begins
- Must kill process with timeout/Ctrl+C

## Test Files Created
1. `test_simple_conditional.xmd` - Basic if statement (HANGS)
2. `test_operators.xmd` - Comprehensive operator tests (UNTESTABLE)
3. `test_basic.xmd` - Baseline test (WORKS)
4. `test_conditionals.xmd` - Full conditional suite (HANGS)

## Recommendation
**CRITICAL FIX NEEDED**: Conditionals completely broken. Developer should investigate:
1. `src/ast/parser/control/ast_parse_if_block/`
2. `src/ast/evaluator/control/ast_evaluate_conditional/`
3. Comparison operator implementation in binary operations

## Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: HIGH - Core language feature non-functional
- **Workaround**: None - conditionals are fundamental
- **Priority**: Must fix before any complex programs can run

## Working Example Output
```
# Basic Test - Only variables and print
10
20
Done
```

This confirms runtime is operational for basic features but fails on control flow.
