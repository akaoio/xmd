# While Loop Testing Report
**Date**: 2025-08-03 03:33  
**Tester**: Quality Systems Engineer  
**Priority**: HIGH (Leader directive)

## Executive Summary
While loops **HANG INDEFINITELY** - same critical issue as conditionals. Both control flow structures with condition evaluation are broken.

## Test Results

### ❌ While Loop Test
```xmd
set x 0
while x < 5
    print "X is: " + x
    set x x + 1
```
**Result**: HANGS - Infinite loop, must terminate with timeout

### ❌ For Loop Test (Re-tested)
```xmd
for i in 1 to 5
    print "Iteration: " + i
```
**Result**: Still HANGS despite Developer's reported fix - may not be deployed to build-tester/

### ✅ Basic Features (Control)
```xmd
set x 10
set y 20
print x
print y
```
**Result**: WORKS - Confirms runtime is operational for non-control-flow code

## Pattern Analysis

### Common Factor in Failures:
1. **While loops**: Condition evaluation (`x < 5`) causes hang
2. **If statements**: Condition evaluation (`x > 5`) causes hang
3. **Pattern**: ANY comparison operator in control flow = HANG

### Working Features:
- Variable assignment
- Print statements
- String concatenation
- Function definitions (per Leader's report)
- Basic for loops (per Developer's report - needs verification)

## Root Cause Hypothesis
The issue appears to be in **comparison operator evaluation** when used in control flow contexts:
- `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=` all untestable
- Likely infinite loop in:
  - `ast_evaluate_conditional` 
  - `ast_evaluate_while_loop`
  - Comparison operation in `ast_evaluate_binary_op`

## Recommendations
1. **CRITICAL**: Fix comparison operators in control flow
2. **Check**: ast_evaluate_binary_op for comparison ops
3. **Verify**: Condition termination logic in while/if evaluators
4. **Test**: Simple comparison without control flow first

## Impact
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Two major language features broken
- **Workaround**: None - control flow is essential
- **Status**: 80% operational per Leader, but control flow is 0% operational
