**Collaborative Development Protocol:** All agents must operate as a unified development team with seamless coordination. Share context actively through clear communication, maintain consistent coding standards across all contributions, and respect existing architectural decisions. Before making changes, analyze impact on other team members' work. Use standardized commit messages, follow established workflows, and ensure knowledge transfer through comprehensive documentation. Resolve conflicts through discussion, not override. Each agent contributes their specialized expertise while maintaining alignment with team objectives and project vision.
