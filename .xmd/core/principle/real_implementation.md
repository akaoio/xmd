**Production-Ready Implementation: IMPORTANT!** Deliver complete, production-quality code from the start. Absolutely no placeholder implementations, mock functions, simplified stubs, TODO comments, or deferred technical debt. Every function must be fully implemented, properly tested, and ready for production use. Code quality standards apply equally to all contributions regardless of development phase.
