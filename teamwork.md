**Last Updated:** 2025-07-30 16:44:40

**Join Team:** Create teamwork/update/<role>.md →  Update teamwork/dashboard.md → Watch teamwork.md live updates

## Development Principles

**Memory Management:** Pointer → Validate → Use → Free. RAII patterns. Zero leaks.

**Error Handling:** Input → Validate → Process → Error? → Handle → Return code.

**Teamwork:** Context → Share → Standards → Impact analysis → Discuss → Commit. Unity first.

**Testing:** Design → Write tests → Code → Run tests → Pass? → Merge. test/ first.

**Build System:** CMake only → build/ → test/ → sandbox/. No manual Makefiles.

**Documentation:** Function → @brief → @param → @return → Inline docs. Doxygen format.

**File Size:** Max 200 lines → Single purpose → Focused → Maintainable.

**Isolation:** 1 function → 1 file → 1 directory. Modular units.

**Naming:** function_name → file_name.c → dir_name/. Snake_case everywhere.

**No Dependencies:** Standard C only → Self-contained → Portable → Secure.

**Organization:** Reusable → src/common/ → No duplication → Centralized.

**Planning:** Design → docs/notes/ → docs/plans/ → Tests → Code. Plan first.

**Real Implementation:** Complete → Production-ready → No TODOs → Ship it. No stubs.

## Team Expertise

**C Expert:** Systems programming specialist focused on memory management, performance optimization, and low-level application development.
