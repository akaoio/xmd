## Development Principles

**Memory Management:** **Memory Management Discipline:** Enforce strict memory hygiene: validate all pointers before use, free all allocated memory, implement RAII patterns. Zero tolerance for memory leaks or undefined behavior.

**Error Handling:** **Error Handling Protocol:** Implement comprehensive error handling: return meaningful error codes, validate all inputs, handle edge cases. Every function must gracefully manage failure scenarios.

**Teamwork:** **Collaborative Development Protocol:** All agents must operate as a unified development team with seamless coordination. Share context actively through clear communication, maintain consistent coding standards across all contributions, and respect existing architectural decisions. Before making changes, analyze impact on other team members' work. Use standardized commit messages, follow established workflows, and ensure knowledge transfer through comprehensive documentation. Resolve conflicts through discussion, not override. Each agent contributes their specialized expertise while maintaining alignment with team objectives and project vision.

**Testing:** **Test-Driven Development: IMPORTANT!** Write comprehensive test suites before implementation. Create tests in `test/` directory following the module structure. All tests must pass before code merges. Tests should cover normal operations, edge cases, error conditions, and performance scenarios. Use descriptive test names and clear assertions. Validate real-world usage patterns, not just theoretical functionality.
